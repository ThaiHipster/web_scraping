Particular emphasis is placed on developing proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics both in English and Greek through the use of the Socratic Method.\n\u200b\nOur Core Values\nOur vibrant school community embodies the following values:\n\u2022 Filotimo (Greek: \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf): \u0391lmost impossible to translate sufficiently, as it describes a complex array of virtues that encompass honor, dignity and pride; to always act with righteousness, integrity, and honor.\n\u2022 Arete (Greek: \u0391\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae): Excellence of any kind and moral virtue. Fulfillment of purpose or function: the act of living up to one's full potential.\n\u2022 Philoxenia (Greek: \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03be\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03b1): eagerness to show hospitality\n\u2022 Ethos (Greek: \u0397\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2): Ethical Behavior\n\u2022 Personal Responsibility: Each person is accountable for their actions and the welfare of their community.\n\u2022 Empathy and Kindness: Engaging in cognitive, emotional, and compassionate understanding of others and responding with kindness.\n\u2022 Respect of Diversity, Equity, and Justice\n\u2022 Moral Courage: Doing what is right and leading by example\n\u2022 Strive for Excellence (Greek: \u0391\u03b9\u03ad\u03bd \u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd): Setting goals and always striving to do one\u2019s best and seeking continuous improvement\n\u200b\n\u200b\nThe Socrates Approach\nThe Academy\u2019s multilingual, multicultural curriculum follows both the North Carolina Essential Standards and Common Core (language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, physical education, art, and music) and the National Greek Curriculum Standards (language arts, mathematics, and Greek culture).\n\u00a0\nInstruction relies on the Socratic Method to foster critical analytical thinking. The program is characterized by high academic quality with a special emphasis in mathematics, reading, writing, character development, multiculturalism, and early learning of a second and third language.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat is the Socratic Method?\nDefinition:the use of questions as employed by Socrates to develop a latent idea, as in the mind of a pupil, or to elicit admissions, as from an opponent,tending to establish a proposition.\n\u00a0\nThe Socratic Method is the oldest, and still the most powerful, teaching tactic for fostering critical thinking. It is also know as inquiry-based teaching. In Socratic teaching we focus on giving students questions, not answers. We model an inquiring, probing mind by continually probing into the subject with questions. Questions are used to arouse curiosity and at the same time serve as a logical, incremental, step-wise guide that enables students to figure out about a complex topic or issue with their own thinking and insights.\n\u00a0\nThe Socratic method is an integral part of instruction at Socrates Academy.\u00a0 This method of thought and analysis has been in use since the time of the ancient Greeks and has been recognized as not only an effective teaching tool, but also an engaging way for students to take an active role in their own education.\n\u00a0\nWant to learn more about how the Socratic Method works in the classroom?\u00a0Read more >>BITMOJI VIRTUAL OPEN HOUSE\nGet to know our teacher and our campus with this fun interactive presentation.

We are so grateful that Socrates Academy is a K-8 school, and that the academic and social transitions from 5th to 6th grade are so seamless here. Elementary classes prepare Socrates students for the academic variety and rigor of the middle school curriculum, and upon graduating to middle school, students have a balanced mix of responsibilities and freedoms that result in opportunities for students to establish their own independence. We look forward to watching our children flourish in their remaining years at Socrates, and feel confident that they will be well-prepared for the next big transition into high school.\"\n\u200b\n- Mary Beth A., Socrates ParentContact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704.321.1711\nFax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

There are a lot of different opinions on how to return to learning this month. About the only thing we can all agree on is that no one is going to be happy with how this school year is starting.We get it. Distance learning doesn\u2019t replace being in a classroom and is a struggle for parents, students, and teachers. At the same time, many educators and parents share concerns about the potential for the spread of COVID-19 at schools.The tough decisions on how communities are returning to schools are being made by your local school leaders under the requirements set forth by Governor Cooper and his team. Every school faces unique challenges that reflect the uniqueness of each community, so different decisions will be made for different communities. Currently, two out of three of North Carolina\u2019s students will start this school year with distance learning.At your NC Department of Public Instruction, we have been supporting local schools and communities by providing multiple strategies on how schools can meet the COVID-19 requirements for in-person learning. We have worked closely with local districts to strengthen distance learning so that it is improved from what students, parents, and teachers faced at the end of last school year. It still will not be perfect, but it will be better and specifically should have more live interactions with teachers, even if over video chats. Please click here to visit our resource page for parents and teachers.Please join us as we work to help encourage each other and our students. We can all agree that no one is happy that COVID-19 has created obstacles unlike any we have ever faced. We don\u2019t have to agree on everything after that, but let\u2019s work together, with grace and encouragement, to overcome the challenges ahead.Sincerely,Mark Johnson\n NC Superintendent of Public Instruction\n @MarkRJohnsonNCContact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704.321.1711\nFax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

There continues to be wide community spread of COVID-19 in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg County area. The CDC has updated their guidance to clarify mitigation strategies based on level of community transmission of COVID-19. It suggests additional strategies \u201c...be considered when there is substantial transmission in the local community\u2026.\u201d including the extension of schools offering distance learning. Three in four cases of COVID-19 occur in individuals ages 20-59. This put a majority of our staff population at risk.While our Board initially voted in favor of Plan B\u2019s hybrid approach to opening, which would have included both in-person and remote instruction, that plan was contingent on having enough teacher support to provide high quality, grade level appropriate instruction to scholars while on campus.  An overwhelming majority of our teachers either cannot return to in-person instruction or are uncomfortable doing so, given the current metrics.  We are concerned about the quality of instruction that would be offered with less than 30% of the teaching staff available or if teachers are pressured to teach in person, against their own wishes.  Accordingly, without sufficient teacher support for the hybrid plan, the Board of Directors has approved our school year to start with remote learning. This decision will be reviewed by October 29, 2020 [the end of 1st quarter].  Our decision to return and the flexibility that will be offered to scholars and teachers desiring to continue with remote learning will be based on the metrics in our community at that time.  We are working through what those benchmarks will be and will communicate them for your planning purposes.More information will come in the following days about our distance learning program.  We are working to ensure that it is more rigorous than what we were forced into in the Spring, while at the same time taking into account families\u2019 schedules and the mental health needs of our scholars. We understand that these are challenging times. It is difficult when we must consider modifying our course of action. Thank you for your support, patience and understanding as we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our scholars and staff    Contact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704.321.1711\nFax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

Staff working the carpool line will enter the number into a tablet and the name will be displayed on a screen in the child\u2019s classroom. You MUST have a new sign to go through carpool.\n\u200b\nMasks & Temperature Checks\nPlease make sure that all occupants in the car are wearing a mask when you stop in the car circle for drop off. Please keep heat low to prevent false temperature readings. Pull to a spot marked by a cone and wait until a staff member opens the door. Do not drop off on your own.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou will be asked three questions by a staff member:\n\u00a0\n\n\nHas your child been a close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes without a mask) in the last 14 days with someone diagnosed with Covid 19 or has the health department told them to quarantine?\n\n\nDoes your child have any of these symptoms: fever, chills, shortness of breath, cough, loss of taste/smell?\n\n\nDoes your child have Co vid 19?\n\n\n\u200b\nIf you answer 'Yes' to any of the questions, your student and all other family members cannot come to school. If you answer 'No', the staff member will check your child's temperature. If it is 100.4 or higher, your child and all other family members cannot come to school. If it is close to 100.4 we may ask you to pull to the side parking lot, wait a few minutes, and then we will re-check it.\n\u200b\nNo Walkers - Morning or Afternoon\nIn an effort to limit exposure we are not allowing visitors on campus which means students who qualify as Walkers by living less than a mile from the school, must be dropped off or picked up during carpool ONLY.\n\u00a0\nLate Pick-Ups\nStudents waiting on parents who are late will not be sent to Afterschool as was done previously. Late Parents will need to park, call the office and walk to the doors, where the student will be waiting.

I continue to be amazed at the dedication of our staff and hard work of our scholars. From Socratic Seminars in 8th grade to Number Detectives in 1st grade, our teachers are engaging scholars in creative ways each day. We miss our scholars and cannot wait until the day they return to the building. But, in the meantime, we are committed to delivering excellence virtually.It is important to note that our teachers are reflecting each day on instruction and scholar needs. Teachers meet multiple times a week to collaboratively plan and analyze student progress. As we progress with remote learning, we will continue to evaluate our strengths and opportunities for improvement. One area we continue to evaluate is our K-4 Special Area classes. Feedback received in the summer was that many parents were concerned about screen time and lengthy school days. Special area classes were designated for one day a week in grades K-4 to reduce screen time and prevent a longer day. Parents have the option to structure the specials day in whatever manner meets the needs of your scholar. Scholars can complete the specials just as scheduled on their assigned day or alternatively, they can complete their specials throughout the week. Going forward, specials will be posted on the grade level weekly planner. Scholars will have until Friday to complete their special area assignments. Some have asked why we continue with special area classes during remote learning. Special area classes are not filler classes. Instead, each class serves a purpose to help our scholars meet standards in the areas of information and technology, physical education, literacy, and the arts. For many scholars, they look forward to these classes and it provides a creative outlet for them to excel. Soon the special area team will begin hosting live sessions for scholars to join and complete activities. Look for more information to come about this exciting event. Contact the special area teacher if you have any questions or concerns regarding the schedule or expectations:Myles Pearl, PE - mpearl@socratesacademy.usAlex Keilen, Technology - akeilen@socratesacademy.usSue Mabon, Library - smabon@socratesacademy.usCarolyn Decker, Music - cdecker@socratesacademy.usKaren Peyton, Art - kpeyton@socratesacademy.us *Special area teachers can also be messaged through Class Dojo messenger.Collaboration between teacher and parent is vital to the success of our scholars. I encourage you to reach out to your scholar\u2019s teacher(s) if you have any questions or concerns. If they can\u2019t help you, they will connect you with the person who can help you. Please make sure you are connected to all of our information platforms - Class Dojo, our website, our Facebook page, and through our weekly Socrates Connection newsletter. Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me directly with any questions.Wishing everyone a wonderful weekend,Ms. BakerContact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704.321.1711\nFax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

Families are invited to donate to the school to support existing educational programs, develop new curriculum, improve school facilities, and support essential needs of Socrates Academy. The money raised through the\u00a0Invest in a Scholar\u00a0program will support exclusively the\u00a0operational needs\u00a0of the school and will not be used for any additional land purchases or new buildings being considered by the Board of Directors.WHY SUPPORT THE ANNUAL FUND?DONATE TO THE ANNUAL FUNDSET UP A RECURRING DONATIONThese Fundraisers Benefit\nOur Annual Fund, too!Here are the three top areas we hope to improve in 2018-2019 using your Annual Fund donations:\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n1)\u00a0Technology in the classroom -\u00a0We strive to educate our scholars in all grades using the latest technology. To do so, we aim to\u00a0update 240 student laptops\u00a0this year to newer models.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2) Teaching Success \u2013 Ongoing professional development ensures our teachers are engaged and equipped with up-to-date knowledge and practices in the classroom. We invest in our staff, significantly beyond what is required by the state of North Carolina, to create a dynamic, 21st century learning environment for our scholars. Additionally, beginning teachers at Socrates Academy receive professional support and guidance from an assigned mentor. These veteran teachers invest tremendous time and energy as mentors and play a vital role in the development and retention of talented new teachers. We would like to\u00a0provide these mentors with an additional stipend\u00a0to reflect the lasting value they pass on to the school and our scholars.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3) Hitting the Books\u00a0\u2013 A strong foundation in reading is a key building block towards long-term academic success. We plan to purchase a diverse range of\u00a0reading materials to be used every day in grades K-3, the foundational years in which student learn how to read. A classroom library that is well-stocked with a wide selection of diverse trade books will enhance their exposure to all genres and make more proficient readers.\u00a0LEARN MOREContact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704.321.1711\nFax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

All grades use this space for lunches, performances, after school events and dances.1/17Frequently Asked Questions\n\u200b\nHow does the lottery work?\nThe date, time and place of the lottery will be communicated to all applicants. The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.\nApplicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.\n\u200b\nApplications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a \"first come, first served\" basis.\n\u200b\nWhat is Siblings Preference?\nSocrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time.\n\u00a0\nWhen an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list.\n\u00a0\nPLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend.\n\u00a0\nIf registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately.\n\u00a0\nIf I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?\nNo, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. \n\u200b\nDo I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?\nNo. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement.\n\u00a0\nWill you give me my child\u2019s number ahead of time?\nNo. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery.\n\u00a0\nDo siblings automatically get in?\nSiblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list.\n\u00a0\nIf a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?\nWe notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?\nNo. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school.\n\u00a0\nHow will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?\nYour acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email.\n\u00a0\nWill results be posted online?\nNo. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons.\n\u00a0\nHow does the lottery work if you have twins?\nTwins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf I\u2019m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?\nYou will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child.\n\u00a0\nHow are the accepted lottery applicants determined?\nThe lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants.\n\u00a0\nMy child wasn\u2019t selected in this year\u2019s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?\nYes. Each time you wish for your child\u2019s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application.\n\u00a0\nCan I submit my child\u2019s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?\nNo. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for.\n\u00a0\nI applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?\nOnly students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement.\n\u00a0\nWhat if I don\u2019t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?\nStudent applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery.\n\u00a0\nWhat if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?\nAny applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received.\n\u00a0\nCan I call the school to get my lottery results?\nWe ask that you check your email before calling the school. Results will not be given over the phone\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan I have someone else pick up my lottery results?\nLottery results will only be provided to a parent or guardian.\n\u200b\n\u200b\u00a0Contact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704.321.1711\nFax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

To learn more about ways to volunteer, contact jsoucey@socratesacademy.us\u00a0\n\u200b\nWhat happens if I don't volunteer?\nOur volunteer commitment is listed in our charter, which means we can be turned down for Charter Renewal or lose the Charter that we have\u200b if we do not meet our volunteer requirements as a school.\u00a0\n\u200b\nWhy do I have to volunteer?\nNorth Carolina charter schools receive state and federal funding for each student. However, state educational funding across North Carolina has declined year over year since 2009, and total funding for charters is still significantly less than for public schools.\n\u00a0\n\n\nCharter schools do not receive a share of the North Carolina Lottery money earmarked for education.\n\n\nCharter schools do not receive state or federal funding for purchase or maintenance of facilities.\n\n\n\u00a0\nIn order for Socrates Academy to continue to provide an exceptional educational experience for all of our scholars, we must seek creative ways to bridge that gap. Volunteering makes a huge difference in this area, while increasing family engagement in the school and strengthening the Socrates community. This is why the volunteer requirement is included in the enrollment paperwork for all Socrates scholars.\n\u200b\nHow many hours do I have to complete?\n36 Volunteer Hours are required from each family that attends Socrates Academy.\n\u200b\n\u00a0\nWhat constitutes a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?\nA volunteer hour is an hour spent at the request of the school (Administration, teachers, BOD, Foundation, PFI) engaged in an activity in support of the school mission.\u00a0 Examples include:\n\u00a0\n\n\nParticipating in Committee work\n\n\nAttending Town Hall meetings or Board Meetings\n\n\nPlanning, setting up and/or breaking down for meetings\n\n\nWork for school at home (worksheet cut outs, scholastic flyers, etc)\n\n\nWorking a special event\n\n\nFulfilling duties for committees\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nWhat does not\u00a0constitute a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?\n\n\nEating lunch with your scholar\n\n\nAttending parent/teacher conferences\n\n\n\u00a0\nCan other family members, (Grandparents, Siblings, Aunt or Uncles) volunteer?\nWe love to see the whole family involved with the school. Additional family members are welcome to volunteer their time and talents with us. We are appreciative of each and every hour they volunteer.\n\u200b\nCan I donate my hours?\nYes. If you have additional hours, please log them either in a friends name, or in your own name. At the end of the year all of the hours are totaled and averaged together.\u00a0\n\u200b\nHow will my hours be tracked?\nUse the volunteer log on the website to track your hours. You are now unable to search your hours online. We are looking at solutions, but for now, please make sure your email address is correct when you log your hours, because totals will be sent there. Please use the same email address each time you fill out the volunteer log.\n\u200b\n\u200b\u00a0\u00a0Contact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704.321.1711\nFax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

An alternative to bringing lunch is to order from our Hot Lunch Menu. Hot Lunch is prepared off site and brought in to the scholars and must be ordered 2-4 weeks in advance. Learn more about Hot Lunch HERE.\n\u00a0\nStudents walk from their classroom to lunch each day with their class and eat in the cafeteria with their teacher.\n\u00a0\nStudents are not permitted to share food.\n\u00a0\nStudents are not permitted to bring soda in their lunches.\n\u00a0\nStudents may not be pulled from class during instruction to have lunch with a sibling unless their lunch schedule is the same.\n\u00a0\nThe Discipline Policy/Code of Conduct applies to all student actions during lunch\n\u00a0\nSocrates Academy provides a table in the cafeteria that is to be kept free of the type of allergen(s) that impact the\nidentified student(s). While this table is available to the identified student(s), they are not be required to eat only at this table.\n\u00a0\nSnacks may be purchased from the Hot Lunch counter with cash only. Items for purchase include, but are not limited to, chips, drinks, muffins and fruit.\n\nFORGOTTEN LUNCHES\nForgotten lunches should be brought to the Middle School building and placed on the stage. Students are taught to check the stage for their lunch before calling home.\n\u00a0\nIf a student has forgotten their lunch and a parent is unable to be reached, they are able to buy lunch with credit from the Hot Lunch counter. The student will need to bring cash money for payment the next day.\n\nVISITING DURING LUNCH\nAny family members visiting during lunch, must sign in with a license at either office. Please meet your child in the cafeteria, not in the classroom.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe ask that parents do not join younger students for lunch during the first two weeks of school, as it can be upsetting to the student when the family member leaves after lunch.\n\u200b\nIf a parent wishes to send in a treat for their child\u2019s birthday, they may coordinate with the homeroom teacher about a time for the treat to be brought to school.

I am grateful to have the opportunity to lead a school with such determined students, a dedicated staff, and a supportive school community.\u00a0 I feel honored to be part of this school and to support the students and families.\u00a0My official start date at CSS is Monday, August 17th, so our students and I will have the same first day. Rest assured that I am working with the board and Ms. Garrison to make this transition as smooth as possible.\nI have been devoted to educating students for eighteen years, working with students ranging in age from 6th through 12th grade in various roles. I started my education career as a middle school counselor, test coordinator, cheer, and softball coach. During this time I worked to make sure that students were growing academically, personally, and socially. After several years in this role, I became interested in what my students were learning and how they learned. This is when I made the switch to school administration; I wanted to focus on the best ways to help students master the curriculum and be successful in the classroom setting. I moved on to become an Assistant Principal at Cary High School for eight years. Most recently, I served as the Instructional Vice Principal at Davis Middle School in Waldorf, Maryland. I am elated to bring my skills as an educational leader to Charlotte Secondary and to collaborate with you as a partner in education to ensure your child\u2019s success.\nI view education as a life-long learning process for students, parents, and faculty alike and look forward to the greatness that will come from the CSS family. More importantly, I bring a belief that students are at the center of all school-related decisions an should be considered in every choice that we make. \u00a0I am excited to unite my experience, my openness to learn, and my child-centered approach to support our students.\u00a0 Because the relationships between families and the school are vital to the success of our students, I encourage you to become involved in every way possible.\u00a0 I look forward to meeting you soon! \u00a0\nIn closing, please know that my door is always open to you. I heartily welcome your conversation and positive input throughout this year. Let us always keep our students the primary focus of our work. I look forward to celebrating our collective successes during the 2020-2021 school year.\n\nSincerely,\nKeisha C.

Being part of an athletic team at CSS requires hard work and dedication to meet responsibilities to the school, parents and teammates.\n\u200bThere are athletics fees associated with each sport. For the 2018-19 school year, this fee is $100. Additionally, before a student is allowed to play a sport, they must submit a physical form for that academic year. Our athletes are held the highest standards in the classroom, outside the school and during competition.\n\u200bCode of Conduct for Student-Athletes at Charlotte Secondary\n\nThe student-athlete shall keep academics as their number one priority.\nThe student-athlete shall play for the joy of the sport, the success of the team, and to win.\nThe student-athlete shall play hard, but fairly, always mindful of the rules and the spirit/intent of the rules. The student-athlete shall treat opponents with respect, shaking hands after all contests.\nThe student-athlete shall respect the judgment of contest officials and accept their decisions.\nThe student-athlete shall exhibit exemplary behavior, thus serving as a positive role model for teammates, opponents, and spectators.\nThe student-athlete shall accept the privileges and responsibilities of representing self, school and community.\u200b\n\nOur goal is to\u00a0 develop the total student-athlete.

It is important to remember, however, that every child\u2019s academic needs are different. And, because every school\u2019s programs and resources vary, parents and students should carefully evaluate a potential school to ensure a good fit between the child\u2019s abilities and the school\u2019s educational philosophy and curriculum.

Regulations: 34 CFR Part 99). This Act was designated to protect the privacy of educational records. Public School Units (PSUs) must annually notify parents and eligible students of their rights under FERPA 34 CFR \u00a7 99.7 which guides the sharing of student directory information and allows them the option to request that the school not disclose this information.\nBeginning in February, 2020, parents and guardians must make an intentional decision to opt-in or opt-out of the sharing of information. The purpose is to ensure parents and guardians are aware of opportunities available to them and to assist families with the updating of selections each year. When parents initially sign in to PowerSchool Parent Portal, they must choose if they desire to share student contact information per FERPA guidelines. Additionally, parents/guardians of high school students must select if they want to share contact information with colleges, universities and the military.\n\u00a0\nEach user of the PowerSchool Parent Portal will be required to answer the applicable questions based on grade level.  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zocVrjWzh5bfQFqLurWxm-2hN-GBn1cL8eEQG88fwyg/edit?usp=sharing\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

Dear Socrates Academy Families and Friends,  Thank you for your ongoing support to the Socrates Academy Annual Fund! Your Annual Fund Gift will have a positive and meaningful impact on the lives of our Socrates Scholars. Will you please join the many parents, staff, and board members who have already contributed to this year\u2019s campaign? Your support will enhance and expand educational opportunities for scholars at our National Blue Ribbon School, one of the top 1% schools in the United States! Your donation can make our great school even better. Here are the three top areas we hope to improve in 2018-2019 using your Annual Fund donations:  1) Technology in the classroom - We strive to educate our scholars in all grades using the latest technology. To do so, we aim to update 240 student laptops this year to newer models.  2) Teaching Success \u2013 Ongoing professional development ensures our teachers are engaged and equipped with up-to-date knowledge and practices in the classroom. We invest in our staff, significantly beyond what is required by the state of North Carolina, to create a dynamic, 21st century learning environment for our scholars. Additionally, beginning teachers at Socrates Academy receive professional support and guidance from an assigned mentor. These veteran teachers invest tremendous time and energy as mentors and play a vital role in the development and retention of talented new teachers. We would like to provide these mentors with an additional stipend to reflect the lasting value they pass on to the school and our scholars.  3) Hitting the Books \u2013 A strong foundation in reading is a key building block towards long-term academic success. We plan to purchase a diverse range of reading materials to be used every day in grades K-3, the foundational years in which student learn how to read. A classroom library that is well-stocked with a wide selection of diverse trade books will enhance their exposure to all genres and make more proficient readers.  Today, charter schools like Socrates Academy receive considerable less per-pupil revenue than district-run traditional public schools. In order to overcome this funding gap and continue to offer award-winning educational and extracurricular programs, Socrates Academy must maintain a supplemental stream of revenue. We\u2019re reaching out to ask for your participation and support again this year.

Our job will be to make classes engaging and informative while preparing students for their life after they graduate. Your job is to make sure the students are here on time each day.\nBecause we are concerned for your child\u2019s safety and well-being, we ask that you notify the school by phone the morning the student is absent no later than 10:00 AM. Failure to do this will result in the student receiving an absence being recorded as unexcused. Call 704-295-0137.\nExcused Absences limited to:\n\nIllness of the student\nMedical appointments\nDeath of an immediate family member\nCourt appearance\nBona fides religious observances\nApproved educational opportunities\n\nDocumentation of these instances is required through one of these methods: a parent\u2019s note to the attendance office, e-mail notification or fax within 5 days of the student\u2019s return. This documentation is required even if you have previously called the office about an absence, and it must be received within the 5-day period. When a student returns to school following an absence, the student is responsible for making up missed work.\nAs a public school, Charlotte Secondary is required to comply with North Carolina\u2019s Compulsory Attendance law (GS 115C\u2011378.) This law states that guardians are responsible for seeing that their children attend school each day it is in session and may be prosecuted in a criminal action if a student, under the age of 16, has multiple unlawful absences. A notification letter is sent by mail stating that legal action will be taken when a student has reached this absence level.\n \n Academic Calendar\n Attendance Policy\n School Lunch Program\n After School Program\n Parent & Family Engagement Policy\n Important Forms\n School Supplies List\n Volunteer Application\n Our Faculty & Staff\n Power School\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 2},

and participate in gifted and talented programs, vocational education, alternative education, and any other services comparable to what housed students receive\nNot be stigmatized or segregated on the basis of their status as homeless\u200b\n\nIn addition to the provisions that apply to all homeless students, the McKinney-Vento Act includes the following provisions specifically for unaccompanied homeless youth:\n\nUnaccompanied homeless youth shall be immediately enrolled without proof of guardianship\nDuring a dispute over school selection or enrollment, unaccompanied homeless youth shall receive a written statement explaining the school\u2019s decision, the youth\u2019s right to appeal the decision, and a referral to the local liaison.\n\nLocal liaisons shall assist unaccompanied homeless youth in:\n\nSelecting a school of attendance and enrolling in school\nRequesting transportation to and from the school of origin\nEnrolling in school immediately while disputes are resolved\u200b\n\nFor more information please visit: NCHEP Profile web page (https://hepnc.uncg.edu/about/)\n \n Academics\n Our Leadership\n Our Faculty & Staff\n Board Members\n PTO\n Careers\n Frequently Asked Questions\n McKinney-Vento Act\n Attend Charlotte Secondary School\n\nCommunity Collaboration\u00a0\nOne of the many important roles the Liaison fills is building relationships with the community and local organizations. These relationships will often prove crucial when a family needs access to services and resources to meet basic needs. Some places to start may include:\u00a0\ncommunity food pantries\u00a0local health services and professionals like dental, health, and mental health needs\u00a0local Boys and Girls Clubs, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, United Way, Salvation Army, and other shelter providers;\u00a0faith-based organizations; and\u00a0local businesses or organizations involved in community service. \u00a0\nDispute Resolution\u00a0\nThe following steps and procedures should take place in resolving disputes regarding enrollment, school placement, or services.\u00a0\nComplaint\u00a0\nA complaint is an oral or written and signed statement alleging the violation of a federal or state law, rule, or regulation. The complaint must allege a violation that occurred not more than one (1) year prior to the date that the complaint is received, unless a longer period is reasonable because the violation is considered systemic or ongoing. Parents, teachers, administrators, or other concerned individuals or organizations may file a complaint (\u201cComplainant\u201d). Faculty and staff with knowledge of a complaint must refer the Complainant to the Liaison. The Complainant may submit the complaint in writing to the Liaison, using the attached Complaint Resolution Initiation Form.

Complainant these written procedures, including the appeal procedures outlined below.\u00a0In the event the school is unable to resolve the complaint, the Complainant may pursue the applicable appeal procedure(s).\u00a0\n\nAppeal Procedures \u2013 North Carolina\n\nIf the dispute is not resolved at the school level, the Complainant may direct the complaint, orally or written, to the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction.\u00a0\nAddress the complaint to the following address:\u00a0\n\nState Coordinator for Homeless Education, National Center for Homeless Education, SERVE Center at UNCG, 5900 Summit Avenue, Ste. 201, Browns Summit, NC 27214.\u00a0\nThe complaint should include:\u00a0\nthe name, address, and telephone number of the person filing the appeal;\u00a0the relationship or connection of the person to the child in question;\u00a0the name and age of the child involved;\u00a0the name of the school and school personnel involved in the complaint;\u00a0the federal requirement alleged to have been violated; a description of the situation that prompted the complaint;\u00a0a description of the attempts that were made to solve the issue;\u00a0supporting documentation; and\u00a0the relief the person is seeking.\u00a0\nThe Liaison will provide the State Homeless Coordinator with any information that the State Homeless Coordinator requests regarding the issues presented in the appeal.\u00a0\nThe State Homeless Coordinator will provide the school and the Complainant the opportunity to respond to any decision made and to provide any additional evidence the Complainant deems relevant.\u00a0\nWithin 10 school days following receipt of the complete appeal, the State Coordinator shall issue a final written decision to the school and the Complainant.\u00a0\nThe Liaison will provide the Complainant an acknowledgement of receipt of the Form Petition and will transmit the Form Petition g the school and receiving transportation services until the Commissioner issues an appeal decision.\u00a0\n\nProfessional Development\u00a0\nLiaison Training\u00a0\nSince ESSA took effect, many states now require Homeless Liaisons to complete training and have a certificate of completion on file. While NHA provides staff training on homeless awareness through OnCourse, the Homeless Liaison at each school should complete the state specific training available and the NCHE Webinars.\u00a0\nStart Professional Development\u00a0\nHomeless Liaisons have a huge role helping so many families and students, but identification of homeless students should not rest on the Liaison alone. All staff at your school may be trained on how to identify homeless students and how to notify the Homeless Liaison of potential homeless students. Federal and state legislation require the Homeless Liaison to conduct staff trainings on these topics annually. This can be accomplished at a staff meeting and documentation such as the agenda or any sign in sheets should be kept as evidence for potential audits. Be sure to take advantage of the readily available presentations located on the NCHE site, or reach out to your State Coordinator for additional resources.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 2},

It is important to remember, however, that every child\u2019s academic needs are different. And, because every school\u2019s programs and resources vary, parents and students should carefully evaluate a potential school to ensure a good fit between the child\u2019s abilities and the school\u2019s educational philosophy and curriculum. CSS strongly encourages parents to attend an Open House and review all prospective family materials.\n\n\n\nWhere do I get an application?\nApplications are available at the school, or you can download using the link below.\nOnce completed, applications can be dropped off or faxed to the school at 704-295-0156. All applications must be signed; we cannot accept an unsigned application, regardless of its delivery method. Applications will be date and time stamped when received. The Lottery will occur on\u00a0March 8, 2019.\u00a0 Applications received after this date will be placed on a waiting list in the order in which they are received.\n Download Student Application\n\n\n\nWhy Charlotte Secondary?\nCharlotte Secondary School knows that children don\u2019t all learn the same way. With individualized instruction, Charlotte Secondary School strives to ensure your child is academically challenged and successful while feeling comfortable in a diverse, safe and bully-free environment. Students actively engage in critical thought and participate in open and respectful discussions. With class sizes at a current 20:1 ratio, your child is guaranteed to receive individual attention and opportunities to academically shine.\nCSS is a great alternative for students who struggle in larger schools.\n\n\n\n\nCurriculum\n\nAre you a college prep school?\nCSS strives to prepare students for \u201cwhat\u2019s next.\u201d\nWe recognize education/schools as the preparation for all Americans to earn a decent livelihood, be a good citizen of the nation and the world, and make a good life for oneself. Our philosophy naturally builds a rigorous college preparatory program \u2013 including 2 and 4-year institutions. Students\u2019 intellectual as well as their ethical and moral growth and their sense of civic responsibility are developed and strengthened. The CSS philosophy supports students\u2019 academic and moral development as closely related skills necessary for developing an individual into an authentic, purposeful learner.\nIn short, we want to prepare our students for life after high school, whether it\u2019s college, community college, technical college or a career.\n\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of a charter school?\n\nImprove student learning\nIncrease learning opportunities for all students with special emphasis on expanded learning experiences for students who are identifies as at risk of academic failure or academically gifted\nEncourage the use of different and innovative teaching methods\nCreate new professional opportunities for teachers\nProvide parents and students with expanded choices\nHold the school accountable for meeting measurable student achievement results\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a charter school?\nCharter schools are public schools in that they:\n\nAre publicly funded through state and local tax revenue;\nDo not charge tuition;\nAre open to all North Carolina residents.\n\nUnlike traditional public schools, though, charter schools are operated by non-profit corporations and governed by the corporation\u2019s Board of Directors rather than the local school board. Also, charter schools are somewhat less regulated than traditional public schools. For example, NC charter schools have more flexibility than traditional public schools with respect to curriculum, teacher salaries and licensure requirements, specifications for school buildings, and purchasing.\nHowever, charter schools are subject to oversight by the State Board of Education and the NC Department of Public Instruction. Charter school facilities must meet all local health and safety requirements and charter school students must take the same end-of-grade and end-of-course tests as other public school students in North Carolina.\nStudents who attend charter schools do so by choice. Charter schools, often referred to as under-funded public schools, receive state and local funding on a per student basis as do traditional public schools. Unlike traditional public schools, charter schools receive no funding for buildings, equipment, campus improvements, technology, transportation, food service, or capital expenditures.\nCSS is a Title 1 school. Please see information below\nClick\u00a0here\u00a0to go to the National Charter School Resource Center website for more information about charter schools.\n\n\n\nWhat are your guiding principles?\nCharlotte Secondary School\u2019s core principles are as follows:\n\nA fundamental purpose of public education is to maintain and advance our democratic society\nA rigorous college preparatory education is the best preparation for civic participation, post-secondary education and the modern workplace\nDiversity is not merely desirable; it is necessary for the accomplishment of our mission\nA good education should be personalized and engage the whole person\nOur teachers will be competent, caring professionals who will grow along with our students\nFamily and community engagement is essential for academic achievement\nA school is always a work in progress; we will pursue continuous improvement through self-assessment and evidence-based practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Documents \n\n\n\nCSS at a Glance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPDF (2.6Mb)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSS at a Glance (ESP)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPDF (2.6Mb)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish Application\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPDF (1Mb)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpanish Application\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPDF (1Mb)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nQuestions?Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Name *FirstLastEmail *Comment or Message *CommentSubmit \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 2},

Our school receives funds from the federal government to help students improve in achievement. Title I money provides both extra teachers to work with children and additional funds to purchase materials, supplies, and training opportunities for staff and parents. The best education of students involves partnerships among the home, school, community, and other support agencies. The involvement of parents is important to the school community and to the success of our students. Parent involvement activities will be reviewed annually by parents.\u00a0 The goal is to ensure parents are involved in the planning and implementation of the Title I program at Charlotte Secondary School.\nAnnual Public Meetings\nAnnual Fall and Spring meetings occur to inform parents about parental involvement requirements, school performance, and methods for measuring progress, school facilities and the School-wide Title I program. At the end of the school year, input is solicited from parents to plan, evaluate, and improve the program for next year. Meetings are held throughout the year to train and involve parents in the education of their children. Quarterly meetings are held to enable parents to see our focus for learning, quarterly expectations and data review as well as to involved parents in celebrating the success of our students.\nRegular Meetings\nParents and students are encouraged to participate in Fall in order to gain information about the school\u2019s performance the previous year, and to discuss initiatives for improvement for the current year. Teachers and administrators schedule parent/student conference whenever deemed necessary by the school or when requested by the parents. These conferences are held before, during, or after school hours.\nFlexible Meetings\nRegular and scheduled parent meetings or conferences are held throughout the school year, at various times of the day, to provide continued information, support, and resources for parents. Parents are encouraged to volunteer and attend all school activities.\nInvolving Parents\nParents are encouraged to participate in school activities. Information shall be provided through workshops, family activities, special events, individual parent conferences, educational materials and literature available through school programs and at the school. The school\u2019s Student Assistance Team/ Multi-Tiered Support Team and IEP committees work with parents to assure parent training is adequate to assist their child with achievement strategies.\nParent Comments\nAt each meeting parents will be asked to participate in an evaluation in order that improvements may be made. Parents are also given surveys to complete. Parents and others may continuously provide input on any matter concerning our school. An open door policy prevails here at CSS. Parents are always welcome to share suggestions and comments with teachers, staff, and administration.\nParent Assistance\nState and local expectations are shared with parents at the Parent Information Meeting in the early Fall. EOG/EOC results are shared at the Fall and Spring Title I Annual Meetings. Results are shared in the school\u2019s newsletter and the principal\u2019s letter to our parent community. All grades are sent home interim progress reports, quarterly report cards and special letters, which indicate the child\u2019s progress.\u00a0 In conjunction with these progress reports, meetings are scheduled with parents to discuss specific concerns.\nOpportunities for LEP and SWD Parents\nAll parents are encouraged to attend school functions. Translators will be arranged for parents who speak languages other than English. Whenever possible, meetings are scheduled at the parent\u2019s convenience. Transportation can be arranged, if necessary.\nParents with Limited English Proficiency, Disabilities, Migratory children\nParents of children with limited English proficiency or disabilities are afforded opportunities to participate fully and freely in all education activities at school. Once the need is identified, assistance shall be provided. Whenever possible, information is sent home in native language. Bilingual staff members, parents, ESL instructors and even students are assigned as liaison between home and school. Charlotte Secondary School is handicap accessible.\nEducation of School Personnel\nSchool staff conducts ongoing reviews of student data to ensure timely reporting out of assessment data to the staff. This ensures the staff the tools to identify at-risk students and in turn, share this information with parents. On-going staff development initiatives are continually provided to the staff which focuses on effective communication with parents, establishing a school/family partnership, ways to involve parents, and suggestions for parents to work with children at home.\nInformation\nClassroom teachers and the administration send home notices on a regular basis, such as the Weekly Newsletter and Calendar, and progress reports, etc. Our school web page and the Power School Parent Portal are also tools for communication. Our ELL tutors and Spanish-Speaking staff are used to adapt communications for parents whose primary language is not English.\nCoordinating and Integrating With Other Programs\nCoordination with other programs is evident, starting with the school\u2019s Leadership Team. Emphasis shall be placed on collaboration with Before and After School Tutoring as well as Summer Programs.\n \n Academic Calendar\n Attendance Policy\n School Lunch Program\n After School Program\n Parent & Family Engagement Policy\n Important Forms\n School Supplies List\n Volunteer Application\n Our Faculty & Staff\n Power School\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 2},

All grades use this space for lunches, performances, after school events and dances.1/17Frequently Asked Questions\n\u200b\nHow does the lottery work?\nThe date, time and place of the lottery will be communicated to all applicants. The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.\nApplicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.\n\u200b\nApplications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a \"first come, first served\" basis.\n\u200b\nWhat is Siblings Preference?\nSocrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time.\n\u00a0\nWhen an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list.\n\u00a0\nPLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend.\n\u00a0\nIf registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately.\n\u00a0\nIf I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?\nNo, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. \n\u200b\nDo I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?\nNo. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement.\n\u00a0\nWill you give me my child\u2019s number ahead of time?\nNo. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery.\n\u00a0\nDo siblings automatically get in?\nSiblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list.\n\u00a0\nIf a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?\nWe notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?\nNo. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school.\n\u00a0\nHow will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?\nYour acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email.\n\u00a0\nWill results be posted online?\nNo. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons.\n\u00a0\nHow does the lottery work if you have twins?\nTwins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf I\u2019m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?\nYou will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child.\n\u00a0\nHow are the accepted lottery applicants determined?\nThe lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants.\n\u00a0\nMy child wasn\u2019t selected in this year\u2019s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?\nYes. Each time you wish for your child\u2019s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application.\n\u00a0\nCan I submit my child\u2019s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?\nNo. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for.\n\u00a0\nI applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?\nOnly students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement.\n\u00a0\nWhat if I don\u2019t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?\nStudent applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery.\n\u00a0\nWhat if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?\nAny applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received.\n\u00a0\nCan I call the school to get my lottery results?\nWe ask that you check your email before calling the school. Results will not be given over the phone\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan I have someone else pick up my lottery results?\nLottery results will only be provided to a parent or guardian.\n\u200b\n\u200b\u00a0Contact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704.321.1711\nFax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 2},

Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list.\n\u00a0\nIf a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?\nWe notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?\nNo. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school.\n\u00a0\nHow will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?\nYour acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email.\n\u00a0\nWill results be posted online?\nNo. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons.\n\u00a0\nHow does the lottery work if you have twins?\nTwins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf I\u2019m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?\nYou will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child.\n\u00a0\nHow are the accepted lottery applicants determined?\nThe lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants.\n\u00a0\nMy child wasn\u2019t selected in this year\u2019s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?\nYes. Each time you wish for your child\u2019s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application.\n\u00a0\nCan I submit my child\u2019s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?\nNo. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for.\n\u00a0\nI applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?\nOnly students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement.\n\u00a0\nWhat if I don\u2019t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?\nStudent applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery.\n\u00a0\nWhat if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?\nAny applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received.\n\u00a0\nCan I call the school to get my lottery results?\nWe ask that you check your email before calling the school.

All grades use this space for lunches, performances, after school events and dances.1/17Frequently Asked Questions\n\u200b\nHow does the lottery work?\nThe date, time and place of the lottery will be communicated to all applicants. The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.\nApplicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.\n\u200b\nApplications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a \"first come, first served\" basis.\n\u200b\nWhat is Siblings Preference?\nSocrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time.\n\u00a0\nWhen an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list.\n\u00a0\nPLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend.\n\u00a0\nIf registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately.\n\u00a0\nIf I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?\nNo, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. \n\u200b\nDo I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?\nNo. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement.\n\u00a0\nWill you give me my child\u2019s number ahead of time?\nNo. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery.\n\u00a0\nDo siblings automatically get in?\nSiblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings.

On June 8 every public school district in North Carolina received information from the state on safely reopening for the 2020-2021 year. Click here to review the reopening \u201ctook kit.\u201d The State is considering one of three options listed below.\u00a0 That decision will be made by July 1.\nThe three potential options are:\nPlan A: Minimal Social Distancing Measures\nPlan B: Moderate Social Distancing Measures (hybrid of plans A & C)\nPlan C: Complete Distance Learning\n\u00a0\nWhat is CSS doing to create each plan?\nWe are working with all CSS staff to meet all state requirements for each of the states 3 plans.\nWhen will families be notified of how school will reopen (plan A, B or C)?\nOnce the state has determined what plan they are choosing to implement, on or around July 1st.\u00a0 CSS will release its plans within the same time period. Please understand that this is constantly fluid situation and the State\u2019s deadline may shift.

It is a good idea to put your sign in a plastic sheet protector or laminate it. \n\n\n\u200b\n\u200b\nAfternoon Carpool (6-8 Students)\n\n\nAll cars will be directed to exit between the two parking islands instead of at the furthest island. \n\t\u00a0\n\n\nIf your student does not come to carpool after the first call, you will be asked to park in the new Second Call Parking Area.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nBegins at 3:30 pm.

The siblings will meet at the carpool zone. \n\n\n\u00a0\nThere are NO left turns out of the school parking lots between the hours of 3:15pm-4:15pm. Cars must be in the parking lot before 3:55pm. If you arrive after carpool has ended, your student will be sent to Afterschool. There is a $1.00 per minute charge up to a maximum of $20.00 for this service.\n\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u200bGeneral Guidelines\n\u00a0\nWalkers\n\n\nScholars who walk must live within one mile of the school, and parents must complete a form to be approved by the administration.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nIf a parent is driving a car to pick up a walker, then he or she must go through the carpool line.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nElementary walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet in front of the Elementary Building.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nMiddle School walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet at the roundabout near the Secondary School.\n\n\n\u200b\u200b\nChurch Next Door\nWe are NOT using the church next door for parking or carpool.

CSS will conduct learning through the \u201cPlan B\u201d Hybrid plan put forth by the state of North Carolina. This means that face-to-face\u00a0 (F2F) learning and remote (online) learning will be offered throughout the weeks to all students. The instructional day will be from 8:00 AM \u2013 1:00 PM.\u00a0\nFor the first two weeks of school (17 \u2013 28 August), CSS will have two optional in-person (classroom) learning days per week, for both middle and high school. We will operate at half capacity and students will attend according to their last name. The remaining days for those two weeks will be remote (online) learning. The third week of school, CSS will move to one optional face-to-face learning day, for both middle and high school according to according to the following options:\nOption(1) Completely virtual: Students will not attend\u00a0 class in person but will attend virtual class meetings from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM and complete assignments remotely.\u00a0\nOption (2) Hybrid F2F: Students will meet on campus once a week from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM for face to face (F2F) instruction in compliance with social distancing guidelines. All other class meetings for the week will be online.\u00a0\nAttendance\nAttendance will be taken daily, for each class regardless of the option selected. Face to Face instruction is not required however, full participation from students is still expected online, in all classes. To be counted present, high school students are required to participate in online Zoom classes and/or complete a check-in assignment. Middle school students are required to be present and participate in the entire\u00a0 Zoom class meeting everyday for each block.\u00a0\nDaily Instruction\u00a0\nThe instructional day is from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM (in person and online). Students will attend classes by block according to their schedule. Teacher office hours are from 1:30 PM \u2013 3:00 PM. Teachers will be available to meet virtually with parents and students upon request.\u00a0\nGrading\nAll assignments will be graded and used to calculate final grades. At this time, state testing has not been waived for the upcoming school year. CSS will continue to prepare students for NC Check-ins, EOC and EOG assessments.\u00a0\u00a0\nDaily Schedule\nMiddle and high school will operate on a four block schedule of 60 minute classes with a 10 minute transition time between classes. There will be a 30 minute break after the second block.\u00a0\n\n\n\nClass Schedule: 8.00 AM \u2013 1:00 PM\n\n\n1st Block\n8:00 AM\u00a0 \u2013 9:00 AM\n\n\n2nd Block\n9:10 AM\u00a0 \u2013 10:10 AM\n\n\nLunch / Break\n10:20 AM\u00a0 \u2013 10:50 PM\n\n\n3rd Block\n10:50 AM\u00a0 \u2013 11:50 AM\n\n\n4th Block\n12: 00 PM\u00a0 \u2013 1.00 PM\n\n\n\nIn order for instructional time to be most effective and helpful to students, CSS needs to know which\u00a0 students are\u00a0 planning to be in the building for Face to Face learning days after the first two weeks of school.\u00a0 The form below must be completed by AUGUST 10, 2020.

Scholars conduct a series of edits, receiving feedback from peers and teachers.GreekElementary\u00a0Students attend 50 minutes of Greek Language and 50 minutes of Greek Math each day. K-2nd Greek Math is co-taught with the Greek & Homeroom teachers.\n\u00a0\nMiddle School Students attend 54 minutes of Greek Language and 54 minutes of Greek Math each day. Greek Language and Greek Math classes are leveled starting in 5th grade.\u00a0\n\u200b\nNew Students in\u00a05th - 8th grade\u00a0are started in beginner Greek classes.

Its mission is to act as the fundraising arm of the Socrates Academy. All programs, projects and activities funded through the Foundation shall be used to enhance the Academy's educational programs and will be in alignment with its strategic plan, mission statement, goals, and budget considerations. Foundation MembersGretchen Carson\nPresident\n\u200b\ngcarson@socratesacademy.us\u00a0Larry Peroulas\nMember\n\u200b\nlarry_peroulas@hotmail.comAntonis Stylianou, Ph.D.\nMember\n\u200b\nastylianou@uncc.eduSocrates Foundation Frequently Asked Questions\n\u200b\nWhy does Socrates Academy need to raise funds? Isn't it a public school?\nSocrates Academy is indeed a public school, but it is also a charter school.\u00a0 Each year, North Carolina charter schools receive a fixed, per-pupil stipend from state and local government sources, which doesn't include funding for a building, bus services or salary increases for teachers with advanced degrees.\u00a0 Socrates Academy must finance facilities expenditures out of general operating revenues, privately raised funds, or partnerships with other organizations. In other words, if we want to purchase or build a new facility, we need to raise those dollars ourselves.\n\u00a0\n\u200b\nWhat is the difference between Annual Funds and Capital Funds?\nAnnual funds are used for operational costs at a school, such as salaries, enrichments, maintenance and supplies. While Capital funds are used for \"brick and mortar type projects\".\u00a0 North Carolina charter schools only receive operations funding, NOT capital funding. Money for building must come from donations or private borrowing.\n\u00a0\n\u200b\nAre we seeking support from outside the school community?\nExternal support will be critical in our effort to raise sufficient funds necessary to purchase the land for our middle school and to build a new building. However, when outside sources are approached, the first question that they ask is \"What have you been able to raise internally?\"\u00a0 It is most important right now that we achieve our goal of 100% participation so that we can better leverage our case outside of our school community. The Fundraising Committee will continue to explore potential donors outside of our internal school community.\n\u00a0\n\u200b\nHow will my funds be used?\nDonations to the Socrates Academy Capital Campaign are used to enhance and grow the school\u2019s infrastructure and campus. In the past, the Capital Campaign has helped the school purchase additional land, construct our Middle School facility, and build an all new 4th and 5th grade facility.\n\u00a0\n\u200b\nWhat is a Matching Gift Program?\nWhen a company or corporation offers gift matching it means when an employee makes a charitable contribution to a non-profit organization, the corporation agrees to pay an equal amount to the same non-profit organization.\n\u00a0\nFor example, if you are an employee of Wells Fargo, you could donate $50.00 to Socrates Academy monthly by bank draft, and Wells Fargo would donate the same amount. That would mean Socrates Academy would receive $100.00 monthly, resulting in a $1200.00 a year!\nClick here to see a list of companies\u00a0we know that DO have Matching Gift programs\n\u00a0\nContact Us\nIf you have any question about the Foundation, fundraising or would like additional information about upcoming initiatives, please feel free to contact us at:\nfoundation@socratesacademy.us\n\u00a0\nSocrates Academy Foundation\n3909 Weddington Road\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704-321-1711 X138Contact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704.321.1711\nFax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

From the moment your child's name is drawn in the enrollment lottery, Socrates Academy\u00a0provides an exceptional range of opportunities for you to engage with their learning experience. We offer opportunities for HomeBase Parents to assist in the classroom.\u00a0Beyond\u00a0the classroom, parents can engage with school clubs to share a love of chess, journalism, or their personal area of expertise.\n\u00a0\nOur commitment to keeping parents fully informed and engaged is reflected in this website. Here you will find information on past and upcoming events, teacher pages with updates on the latest happenings in the classroom and the extended learning that our scholars bring home, and contact information for your child's teachers.

This atmosphere provides our students with a variety of experiential learning opportunities. As specified in our charter, we actively recruit students who thrive in a smaller school environment, as well as those who are traditionally under-represented in high school college preparatory programs.\nPrimarily a college and career preparatory school, we gather students from all educational backgrounds and provide them with avenues of enrichment and study that cater to their individual needs. Ultimately our charge is to guide all students in the discovery of their own particular genius, a crucial step in a distinctive life-path.\nOur History\nCharlotte Secondary School is a public charter school that opened in 2007 serving students in middle school grades 6-8. Recognized as a School of Distinction in 2011, the school moved to larger facility and expanded to grades 6-12 in 2014. Charlotte Secondary graduated the first senior class in 2016 with 32 of the 36 graduates enrolling in a 2 or 4-year college.\nOur current senior class exceeds the state average in all 4 college-readiness benchmarks measured by the ACT (English, Math, Reading and Science). Our students continue the tradition of academic excellence set by that first class.\nOur Mission\nWe are a diverse middle and high school community that focuses on college and career preparation and individually tailored learning opportunities to empower all students to reach their full potential.\nOur Vision\nCSS students will be critical thinkers and effective communicators, engaged citizens and life-long learners.\n \n Academics\n Our Leadership\n Our Faculty & Staff\n Board Members\n PTO\n Careers\n Frequently Asked Questions\n McKinney-Vento Act\n Attend Charlotte Secondary School\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

Today we would like to announce that CSS will go to FULL REMOTE learning starting on August 17, 2020.\u00a0 We have been working diligently over the summer to come up with the safest & healthiest way to begin this school year and had hoped that we would be welcoming students & staff into the building. With CMS deciding last week to go completely remote, we feel at this time that CSS should follow Plan C as well to ensure the safety of our students and staff.\nWe still have quite a few details to work out and will update you as soon as we can. We are planning an Open House of sorts and appreciate your patience with us as we continue to plan for this school year.\nThank you.\nAttendance\nAttendance will be taken daily, for each class. Full participation from students is expected online in all classes. To be counted present, high school students are required to participate in online Zoom classes and/or complete a check-in assignment. Middle school students are required to be present and participate in the entire\u00a0 Zoom class meeting everyday for each block.\nDaily Instruction\nThe instructional day is from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM (online).\u00a0 Students will attend classes by block according to their schedule. Teacher office hours are from 1:30 PM \u2013 3:00 PM. Teachers will be available to meet virtually with parents and students upon request.\nGrading\nAll assignments will be graded and used to calculate final grades. At this time, state testing has not been waived\u00a0 for the upcoming school year.\u00a0 CSS will continue to prepare students for NC Check-ins, EOC and EOG assessments.\nDaily Schedule\nMiddle and high school will operate on a four block schedule of 60 minute classes with a 10 minute transition time between classes.

Particular emphasis is placed on developing proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics both in English and Greek through the use of the Socratic Method.\n\u200b\nOur Core Values\nOur vibrant school community embodies the following values:\n\u2022 Filotimo (Greek: \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf): \u0391lmost impossible to translate sufficiently, as it describes a complex array of virtues that encompass honor, dignity and pride; to always act with righteousness, integrity, and honor.\n\u2022 Arete (Greek: \u0391\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae): Excellence of any kind and moral virtue. Fulfillment of purpose or function: the act of living up to one's full potential.\n\u2022 Philoxenia (Greek: \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03be\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03b1): eagerness to show hospitality\n\u2022 Ethos (Greek: \u0397\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2): Ethical Behavior\n\u2022 Personal Responsibility: Each person is accountable for their actions and the welfare of their community.\n\u2022 Empathy and Kindness: Engaging in cognitive, emotional, and compassionate understanding of others and responding with kindness.\n\u2022 Respect of Diversity, Equity, and Justice\n\u2022 Moral Courage: Doing what is right and leading by example\n\u2022 Strive for Excellence (Greek: \u0391\u03b9\u03ad\u03bd \u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd): Setting goals and always striving to do one\u2019s best and seeking continuous improvement\n\u200b\n\u200b\nThe Socrates Approach\nThe Academy\u2019s multilingual, multicultural curriculum follows both the North Carolina Essential Standards and Common Core (language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, physical education, art, and music) and the National Greek Curriculum Standards (language arts, mathematics, and Greek culture).\n\u00a0\nInstruction relies on the Socratic Method to foster critical analytical thinking. The program is characterized by high academic quality with a special emphasis in mathematics, reading, writing, character development, multiculturalism, and early learning of a second and third language.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat is the Socratic Method?\nDefinition:the use of questions as employed by Socrates to develop a latent idea, as in the mind of a pupil, or to elicit admissions, as from an opponent,tending to establish a proposition.\n\u00a0\nThe Socratic Method is the oldest, and still the most powerful, teaching tactic for fostering critical thinking. It is also know as inquiry-based teaching. In Socratic teaching we focus on giving students questions, not answers. We model an inquiring, probing mind by continually probing into the subject with questions. Questions are used to arouse curiosity and at the same time serve as a logical, incremental, step-wise guide that enables students to figure out about a complex topic or issue with their own thinking and insights.\n\u00a0\nThe Socratic method is an integral part of instruction at Socrates Academy.\u00a0 This method of thought and analysis has been in use since the time of the ancient Greeks and has been recognized as not only an effective teaching tool, but also an engaging way for students to take an active role in their own education.\n\u00a0\nWant to learn more about how the Socratic Method works in the classroom?\u00a0Read more >>BITMOJI VIRTUAL OPEN HOUSE\nGet to know our teacher and our campus with this fun interactive presentation.

We are so grateful that Socrates Academy is a K-8 school, and that the academic and social transitions from 5th to 6th grade are so seamless here. Elementary classes prepare Socrates students for the academic variety and rigor of the middle school curriculum, and upon graduating to middle school, students have a balanced mix of responsibilities and freedoms that result in opportunities for students to establish their own independence. We look forward to watching our children flourish in their remaining years at Socrates, and feel confident that they will be well-prepared for the next big transition into high school.\"\n\u200b\n- Mary Beth A., Socrates ParentContact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704.321.1711\nFax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

For example, K-2 students begin on November 3rd, NOT November 2nd.Carpool Tag Pick-up & Supply Drop Off\nFamilies will be given numbers instead of names for carpool this year. Staff working the carpool line will enter the number into a tablet and the name will be displayed on a screen in the child\u2019s classroom. You MUST have a new sign to go through carpool.\n\u200b\nMasks & Temperature Checks\nPlease make sure that all occupants in the car are wearing a mask when you stop in the car circle for drop off. Please keep heat low to prevent false temperature readings. Pull to a spot marked by a cone and wait until a staff member opens the door. Do not drop off on your own.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou will be asked three questions by a staff member:\n\u00a0\n\n\nHas your child been a close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes without a mask) in the last 14 days with someone diagnosed with Covid 19 or has the health department told them to quarantine?\n\n\nDoes your child have any of these symptoms: fever, chills, shortness of breath, cough, loss of taste/smell?\n\n\nDoes your child have Co vid 19?\n\n\n\u200b\nIf you answer 'Yes' to any of the questions, your student and all other family members cannot come to school. If you answer 'No', the staff member will check your child's temperature. If it is 100.4 or higher, your child and all other family members cannot come to school. If it is close to 100.4 we may ask you to pull to the side parking lot, wait a few minutes, and then we will re-check it.\n\u200b\nNo Walkers - Morning or Afternoon\nIn an effort to limit exposure we are not allowing visitors on campus which means students who qualify as Walkers by living less than a mile from the school, must be dropped off or picked up during carpool ONLY.\n\u00a0\nLate Pick-Ups\nStudents waiting on parents who are late will not be sent to Afterschool as was done previously. Late Parents will need to park, call the office and walk to the doors, where the student will be waiting.

There continues to be wide community spread of COVID-19 in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg County area. The CDC has updated their guidance to clarify mitigation strategies based on level of community transmission of COVID-19. It suggests additional strategies \u201c...be considered when there is substantial transmission in the local community\u2026.\u201d including the extension of schools offering distance learning. Three in four cases of COVID-19 occur in individuals ages 20-59. This put a majority of our staff population at risk.While our Board initially voted in favor of Plan B\u2019s hybrid approach to opening, which would have included both in-person and remote instruction, that plan was contingent on having enough teacher support to provide high quality, grade level appropriate instruction to scholars while on campus.  An overwhelming majority of our teachers either cannot return to in-person instruction or are uncomfortable doing so, given the current metrics.  We are concerned about the quality of instruction that would be offered with less than 30% of the teaching staff available or if teachers are pressured to teach in person, against their own wishes.  Accordingly, without sufficient teacher support for the hybrid plan, the Board of Directors has approved our school year to start with remote learning. This decision will be reviewed by October 29, 2020 [the end of 1st quarter].  Our decision to return and the flexibility that will be offered to scholars and teachers desiring to continue with remote learning will be based on the metrics in our community at that time.  We are working through what those benchmarks will be and will communicate them for your planning purposes.More information will come in the following days about our distance learning program.  We are working to ensure that it is more rigorous than what we were forced into in the Spring, while at the same time taking into account families\u2019 schedules and the mental health needs of our scholars. We understand that these are challenging times. It is difficult when we must consider modifying our course of action. Thank you for your support, patience and understanding as we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our scholars and staff    Contact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704.321.1711\nFax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

There are a lot of different opinions on how to return to learning this month. About the only thing we can all agree on is that no one is going to be happy with how this school year is starting.We get it. Distance learning doesn\u2019t replace being in a classroom and is a struggle for parents, students, and teachers. At the same time, many educators and parents share concerns about the potential for the spread of COVID-19 at schools.The tough decisions on how communities are returning to schools are being made by your local school leaders under the requirements set forth by Governor Cooper and his team. Every school faces unique challenges that reflect the uniqueness of each community, so different decisions will be made for different communities. Currently, two out of three of North Carolina\u2019s students will start this school year with distance learning.At your NC Department of Public Instruction, we have been supporting local schools and communities by providing multiple strategies on how schools can meet the COVID-19 requirements for in-person learning. We have worked closely with local districts to strengthen distance learning so that it is improved from what students, parents, and teachers faced at the end of last school year. It still will not be perfect, but it will be better and specifically should have more live interactions with teachers, even if over video chats. Please click here to visit our resource page for parents and teachers.Please join us as we work to help encourage each other and our students. We can all agree that no one is happy that COVID-19 has created obstacles unlike any we have ever faced. We don\u2019t have to agree on everything after that, but let\u2019s work together, with grace and encouragement, to overcome the challenges ahead.Sincerely,Mark Johnson\n NC Superintendent of Public Instruction\n @MarkRJohnsonNCContact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704.321.1711\nFax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

Families are invited to donate to the school to support existing educational programs, develop new curriculum, improve school facilities, and support essential needs of Socrates Academy. The money raised through the\u00a0Invest in a Scholar\u00a0program will support exclusively the\u00a0operational needs\u00a0of the school and will not be used for any additional land purchases or new buildings being considered by the Board of Directors.WHY SUPPORT THE ANNUAL FUND?DONATE TO THE ANNUAL FUNDSET UP A RECURRING DONATIONThese Fundraisers Benefit\nOur Annual Fund, too!Here are the three top areas we hope to improve in 2018-2019 using your Annual Fund donations:\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n1)\u00a0Technology in the classroom -\u00a0We strive to educate our scholars in all grades using the latest technology. To do so, we aim to\u00a0update 240 student laptops\u00a0this year to newer models.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2) Teaching Success \u2013 Ongoing professional development ensures our teachers are engaged and equipped with up-to-date knowledge and practices in the classroom. We invest in our staff, significantly beyond what is required by the state of North Carolina, to create a dynamic, 21st century learning environment for our scholars. Additionally, beginning teachers at Socrates Academy receive professional support and guidance from an assigned mentor. These veteran teachers invest tremendous time and energy as mentors and play a vital role in the development and retention of talented new teachers. We would like to\u00a0provide these mentors with an additional stipend\u00a0to reflect the lasting value they pass on to the school and our scholars.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3) Hitting the Books\u00a0\u2013 A strong foundation in reading is a key building block towards long-term academic success. We plan to purchase a diverse range of\u00a0reading materials to be used every day in grades K-3, the foundational years in which student learn how to read. A classroom library that is well-stocked with a wide selection of diverse trade books will enhance their exposure to all genres and make more proficient readers.\u00a0LEARN MOREContact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704.321.1711\nFax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

I continue to be amazed at the dedication of our staff and hard work of our scholars. From Socratic Seminars in 8th grade to Number Detectives in 1st grade, our teachers are engaging scholars in creative ways each day. We miss our scholars and cannot wait until the day they return to the building. But, in the meantime, we are committed to delivering excellence virtually.It is important to note that our teachers are reflecting each day on instruction and scholar needs. Teachers meet multiple times a week to collaboratively plan and analyze student progress. As we progress with remote learning, we will continue to evaluate our strengths and opportunities for improvement. One area we continue to evaluate is our K-4 Special Area classes. Feedback received in the summer was that many parents were concerned about screen time and lengthy school days. Special area classes were designated for one day a week in grades K-4 to reduce screen time and prevent a longer day. Parents have the option to structure the specials day in whatever manner meets the needs of your scholar. Scholars can complete the specials just as scheduled on their assigned day or alternatively, they can complete their specials throughout the week. Going forward, specials will be posted on the grade level weekly planner. Scholars will have until Friday to complete their special area assignments. Some have asked why we continue with special area classes during remote learning. Special area classes are not filler classes. Instead, each class serves a purpose to help our scholars meet standards in the areas of information and technology, physical education, literacy, and the arts. For many scholars, they look forward to these classes and it provides a creative outlet for them to excel. Soon the special area team will begin hosting live sessions for scholars to join and complete activities. Look for more information to come about this exciting event. Contact the special area teacher if you have any questions or concerns regarding the schedule or expectations:Myles Pearl, PE - mpearl@socratesacademy.usAlex Keilen, Technology - akeilen@socratesacademy.usSue Mabon, Library - smabon@socratesacademy.usCarolyn Decker, Music - cdecker@socratesacademy.usKaren Peyton, Art - kpeyton@socratesacademy.us *Special area teachers can also be messaged through Class Dojo messenger.Collaboration between teacher and parent is vital to the success of our scholars. I encourage you to reach out to your scholar\u2019s teacher(s) if you have any questions or concerns. If they can\u2019t help you, they will connect you with the person who can help you. Please make sure you are connected to all of our information platforms - Class Dojo, our website, our Facebook page, and through our weekly Socrates Connection newsletter. Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me directly with any questions.Wishing everyone a wonderful weekend,Ms. BakerContact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704.321.1711\nFax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

All grades use this space for lunches, performances, after school events and dances.1/17Frequently Asked Questions\n\u200b\nHow does the lottery work?\nThe date, time and place of the lottery will be communicated to all applicants. The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.\nApplicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.\n\u200b\nApplications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a \"first come, first served\" basis.\n\u200b\nWhat is Siblings Preference?\nSocrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time.\n\u00a0\nWhen an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list.\n\u00a0\nPLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend.\n\u00a0\nIf registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately.\n\u00a0\nIf I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?\nNo, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. \n\u200b\nDo I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?\nNo. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement.\n\u00a0\nWill you give me my child\u2019s number ahead of time?\nNo. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery.\n\u00a0\nDo siblings automatically get in?\nSiblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list.\n\u00a0\nIf a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?\nWe notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?\nNo. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school.\n\u00a0\nHow will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?\nYour acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email.\n\u00a0\nWill results be posted online?\nNo. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons.\n\u00a0\nHow does the lottery work if you have twins?\nTwins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf I\u2019m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?\nYou will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child.\n\u00a0\nHow are the accepted lottery applicants determined?\nThe lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants.\n\u00a0\nMy child wasn\u2019t selected in this year\u2019s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?\nYes. Each time you wish for your child\u2019s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application.\n\u00a0\nCan I submit my child\u2019s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?\nNo. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for.\n\u00a0\nI applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?\nOnly students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement.\n\u00a0\nWhat if I don\u2019t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?\nStudent applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery.\n\u00a0\nWhat if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?\nAny applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received.\n\u00a0\nCan I call the school to get my lottery results?\nWe ask that you check your email before calling the school. Results will not be given over the phone\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan I have someone else pick up my lottery results?\nLottery results will only be provided to a parent or guardian.\n\u200b\n\u200b\u00a0Contact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704.321.1711\nFax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

To learn more about ways to volunteer, contact jsoucey@socratesacademy.us\u00a0\n\u200b\nWhat happens if I don't volunteer?\nOur volunteer commitment is listed in our charter, which means we can be turned down for Charter Renewal or lose the Charter that we have\u200b if we do not meet our volunteer requirements as a school.\u00a0\n\u200b\nWhy do I have to volunteer?\nNorth Carolina charter schools receive state and federal funding for each student. However, state educational funding across North Carolina has declined year over year since 2009, and total funding for charters is still significantly less than for public schools.\n\u00a0\n\n\nCharter schools do not receive a share of the North Carolina Lottery money earmarked for education.\n\n\nCharter schools do not receive state or federal funding for purchase or maintenance of facilities.\n\n\n\u00a0\nIn order for Socrates Academy to continue to provide an exceptional educational experience for all of our scholars, we must seek creative ways to bridge that gap. Volunteering makes a huge difference in this area, while increasing family engagement in the school and strengthening the Socrates community. This is why the volunteer requirement is included in the enrollment paperwork for all Socrates scholars.\n\u200b\nHow many hours do I have to complete?\n36 Volunteer Hours are required from each family that attends Socrates Academy.\n\u200b\n\u00a0\nWhat constitutes a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?\nA volunteer hour is an hour spent at the request of the school (Administration, teachers, BOD, Foundation, PFI) engaged in an activity in support of the school mission.\u00a0 Examples include:\n\u00a0\n\n\nParticipating in Committee work\n\n\nAttending Town Hall meetings or Board Meetings\n\n\nPlanning, setting up and/or breaking down for meetings\n\n\nWork for school at home (worksheet cut outs, scholastic flyers, etc)\n\n\nWorking a special event\n\n\nFulfilling duties for committees\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nWhat does not\u00a0constitute a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?\n\n\nEating lunch with your scholar\n\n\nAttending parent/teacher conferences\n\n\n\u00a0\nCan other family members, (Grandparents, Siblings, Aunt or Uncles) volunteer?\nWe love to see the whole family involved with the school. Additional family members are welcome to volunteer their time and talents with us. We are appreciative of each and every hour they volunteer.\n\u200b\nCan I donate my hours?\nYes. If you have additional hours, please log them either in a friends name, or in your own name. At the end of the year all of the hours are totaled and averaged together.\u00a0\n\u200b\nHow will my hours be tracked?\nUse the volunteer log on the website to track your hours. You are now unable to search your hours online. We are looking at solutions, but for now, please make sure your email address is correct when you log your hours, because totals will be sent there. Please use the same email address each time you fill out the volunteer log.\n\u200b\n\u200b\u00a0\u00a0Contact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704.321.1711\nFax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

An alternative to bringing lunch is to order from our Hot Lunch Menu. Hot Lunch is prepared off site and brought in to the scholars and must be ordered 2-4 weeks in advance. Learn more about Hot Lunch HERE.\n\u00a0\nStudents walk from their classroom to lunch each day with their class and eat in the cafeteria with their teacher.\n\u00a0\nStudents are not permitted to share food.\n\u00a0\nStudents are not permitted to bring soda in their lunches.\n\u00a0\nStudents may not be pulled from class during instruction to have lunch with a sibling unless their lunch schedule is the same.\n\u00a0\nThe Discipline Policy/Code of Conduct applies to all student actions during lunch\n\u00a0\nSocrates Academy provides a table in the cafeteria that is to be kept free of the type of allergen(s) that impact the\nidentified student(s). While this table is available to the identified student(s), they are not be required to eat only at this table.\n\u00a0\nSnacks may be purchased from the Hot Lunch counter with cash only. Items for purchase include, but are not limited to, chips, drinks, muffins and fruit.\n\nFORGOTTEN LUNCHES\nForgotten lunches should be brought to the Middle School building and placed on the stage. Students are taught to check the stage for their lunch before calling home.\n\u00a0\nIf a student has forgotten their lunch and a parent is unable to be reached, they are able to buy lunch with credit from the Hot Lunch counter. The student will need to bring cash money for payment the next day.\n\nVISITING DURING LUNCH\nAny family members visiting during lunch, must sign in with a license at either office. Please meet your child in the cafeteria, not in the classroom.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe ask that parents do not join younger students for lunch during the first two weeks of school, as it can be upsetting to the student when the family member leaves after lunch.\n\u200b\nIf a parent wishes to send in a treat for their child\u2019s birthday, they may coordinate with the homeroom teacher about a time for the treat to be brought to school. It is the policy of Socrates Academy that all food provided for consumption of our scholars must be commercially prepared, with the ingredient label visible. Our allergy management policy can be found HERE\n\u200b\nVolunteers are needed to work behind the Hot Lunch counter and also in the main cafeteria area.

Dear Socrates Academy Families and Friends,  Thank you for your ongoing support to the Socrates Academy Annual Fund! Your Annual Fund Gift will have a positive and meaningful impact on the lives of our Socrates Scholars. Will you please join the many parents, staff, and board members who have already contributed to this year\u2019s campaign? Your support will enhance and expand educational opportunities for scholars at our National Blue Ribbon School, one of the top 1% schools in the United States! Your donation can make our great school even better. Here are the three top areas we hope to improve in 2018-2019 using your Annual Fund donations:  1) Technology in the classroom - We strive to educate our scholars in all grades using the latest technology. To do so, we aim to update 240 student laptops this year to newer models.  2) Teaching Success \u2013 Ongoing professional development ensures our teachers are engaged and equipped with up-to-date knowledge and practices in the classroom. We invest in our staff, significantly beyond what is required by the state of North Carolina, to create a dynamic, 21st century learning environment for our scholars. Additionally, beginning teachers at Socrates Academy receive professional support and guidance from an assigned mentor. These veteran teachers invest tremendous time and energy as mentors and play a vital role in the development and retention of talented new teachers. We would like to provide these mentors with an additional stipend to reflect the lasting value they pass on to the school and our scholars.  3) Hitting the Books \u2013 A strong foundation in reading is a key building block towards long-term academic success. We plan to purchase a diverse range of reading materials to be used every day in grades K-3, the foundational years in which student learn how to read. A classroom library that is well-stocked with a wide selection of diverse trade books will enhance their exposure to all genres and make more proficient readers.  Today, charter schools like Socrates Academy receive considerable less per-pupil revenue than district-run traditional public schools. In order to overcome this funding gap and continue to offer award-winning educational and extracurricular programs, Socrates Academy must maintain a supplemental stream of revenue.

I am grateful to have the opportunity to lead a school with such determined students, a dedicated staff, and a supportive school community.\u00a0 I feel honored to be part of this school and to support the students and families.\u00a0My official start date at CSS is Monday, August 17th, so our students and I will have the same first day. Rest assured that I am working with the board and Ms. Garrison to make this transition as smooth as possible.\nI have been devoted to educating students for eighteen years, working with students ranging in age from 6th through 12th grade in various roles. I started my education career as a middle school counselor, test coordinator, cheer, and softball coach. During this time I worked to make sure that students were growing academically, personally, and socially. After several years in this role, I became interested in what my students were learning and how they learned. This is when I made the switch to school administration; I wanted to focus on the best ways to help students master the curriculum and be successful in the classroom setting. I moved on to become an Assistant Principal at Cary High School for eight years. Most recently, I served as the Instructional Vice Principal at Davis Middle School in Waldorf, Maryland. I am elated to bring my skills as an educational leader to Charlotte Secondary and to collaborate with you as a partner in education to ensure your child\u2019s success.\nI view education as a life-long learning process for students, parents, and faculty alike and look forward to the greatness that will come from the CSS family. More importantly, I bring a belief that students are at the center of all school-related decisions an should be considered in every choice that we make. \u00a0I am excited to unite my experience, my openness to learn, and my child-centered approach to support our students.\u00a0 Because the relationships between families and the school are vital to the success of our students, I encourage you to become involved in every way possible.\u00a0 I look forward to meeting you soon! \u00a0\nIn closing, please know that my door is always open to you. I heartily welcome your conversation and positive input throughout this year. Let us always keep our students the primary focus of our work. I look forward to celebrating our collective successes during the 2020-2021 school year.\n\nSincerely,\nKeisha C.

If you are coming from Antioch Church Road, we encourage you to turn right into the lower parking lot (entrance near the Couchell Building). \n\t\u00a0\n\n\nDo not stop in front of a building.

If a carpool sign is not present, the car will be pulled to the side, driver ID checked, and driver verified as an authorized driver on the carpool form with the office staff.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nPlease keep your carpool sign from year to year, unless there is a change that needs to be made to the sign. It is a good idea to put your sign in a plastic sheet protector or laminate it. \n\n\n\u200b\n\u200b\nAfternoon Carpool (6-8 Students)\n\n\nAll cars will be directed to exit between the two parking islands instead of at the furthest island. \n\t\u00a0\n\n\nIf your student does not come to carpool after the first call, you will be asked to park in the new Second Call Parking Area.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nBegins at 3:30 pm.

Grades 4 and 5 are dismissed from the upper parking lot (with and without siblings). \n\t\u00a0\n\n\nGrades K-3 are dismissed from the lower lot (only if they do not have 4th-8th grade\u00a0siblings).\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nAll students will go to the classroom of their older sibling for carpool. This includes K-3 students that have siblings in Middle School.\u00a0\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nK-3 students with Middle School siblings, will not come into the Middle School, but will be supervised in the 4th and 5th Grade building. They will be called at the same time that their Middle School Sibling is called. The siblings will meet at the carpool zone. \n\n\n\u00a0\nThere are NO left turns out of the school parking lots between the hours of 3:15pm-4:15pm. Cars must be in the parking lot before 3:55pm. If you arrive after carpool has ended, your student will be sent to Afterschool. There is a $1.00 per minute charge up to a maximum of $20.00 for this service.\n\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u200bGeneral Guidelines\n\u00a0\nWalkers\n\n\nScholars who walk must live within one mile of the school, and parents must complete a form to be approved by the administration.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nIf a parent is driving a car to pick up a walker, then he or she must go through the carpool line.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nElementary walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet in front of the Elementary Building.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nMiddle School walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet at the roundabout near the Secondary School.\n\n\n\u200b\u200b\nChurch Next Door\nWe are NOT using the church next door for parking or carpool.

Parents are not to wait in the church parking lot until it is 3:00pm, when you are permitted to enter our lot for elementary dismissal.\n\u200b\u200b\nCell Phones\nCell phone use is prohibited to ensure that everyone is focused on keeping our scholars safe.

The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.\nApplicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.\n\u200b\nApplications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a \"first come, first served\" basis.\n\u200b\nWhat is Siblings Preference?\nSocrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time.\n\u00a0\nWhen an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list.\n\u00a0\nPLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend.\n\u00a0\nIf registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately.\n\u00a0\nIf I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?\nNo, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. \n\u200b\nDo I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?\nNo. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement.\n\u00a0\nWill you give me my child\u2019s number ahead of time?\nNo. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery.\n\u00a0\nDo siblings automatically get in?\nSiblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list.\n\u00a0\nIf a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?\nWe notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?\nNo. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school.\n\u00a0\nHow will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?\nYour acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email.\n\u00a0\nWill results be posted online?\nNo. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons.\n\u00a0\nHow does the lottery work if you have twins?\nTwins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf I\u2019m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?\nYou will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child.\n\u00a0\nHow are the accepted lottery applicants determined?\nThe lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants.\n\u00a0\nMy child wasn\u2019t selected in this year\u2019s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?\nYes. Each time you wish for your child\u2019s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application.\n\u00a0\nCan I submit my child\u2019s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?\nNo. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for.\n\u00a0\nI applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?\nOnly students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement.\n\u00a0\nWhat if I don\u2019t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?\nStudent applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery.\n\u00a0\nWhat if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?\nAny applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received.\n\u00a0\nCan I call the school to get my lottery results?\nWe ask that you check your email before calling the school.

Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list.\n\u00a0\nPLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend.\n\u00a0\nIf registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately.\n\u00a0\nIf I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?\nNo, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. \n\u200b\nDo I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?\nNo. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement.\n\u00a0\nWill you give me my child\u2019s number ahead of time?\nNo. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery.\n\u00a0\nDo siblings automatically get in?\nSiblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list.\n\u00a0\nIf a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?\nWe notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?\nNo. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school.\n\u00a0\nHow will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?\nYour acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email.\n\u00a0\nWill results be posted online?\nNo. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons.\n\u00a0\nHow does the lottery work if you have twins?\nTwins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf I\u2019m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?\nYou will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child.\n\u00a0\nHow are the accepted lottery applicants determined?\nThe lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants.\n\u00a0\nMy child wasn\u2019t selected in this year\u2019s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?\nYes. Each time you wish for your child\u2019s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application.\n\u00a0\nCan I submit my child\u2019s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?\nNo. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for.\n\u00a0\nI applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?\nOnly students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement.\n\u00a0\nWhat if I don\u2019t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?\nStudent applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery.\n\u00a0\nWhat if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?\nAny applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received.\n\u00a0\nCan I call the school to get my lottery results?\nWe ask that you check your email before calling the school. Results will not be given over the phone\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan I have someone else pick up my lottery results?\nLottery results will only be provided to a parent or guardian.\n\u200b\n\u200b\u00a0Contact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704.321.1711\nFax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 2},

CSS will conduct learning through the \u201cPlan B\u201d Hybrid plan put forth by the state of North Carolina. This means that face-to-face\u00a0 (F2F) learning and remote (online) learning will be offered throughout the weeks to all students. The instructional day will be from 8:00 AM \u2013 1:00 PM.\u00a0\nFor the first two weeks of school (17 \u2013 28 August), CSS will have two optional in-person (classroom) learning days per week, for both middle and high school. We will operate at half capacity and students will attend according to their last name. The remaining days for those two weeks will be remote (online) learning. The third week of school, CSS will move to one optional face-to-face learning day, for both middle and high school according to according to the following options:\nOption(1) Completely virtual: Students will not attend\u00a0 class in person but will attend virtual class meetings from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM and complete assignments remotely.\u00a0\nOption (2) Hybrid F2F: Students will meet on campus once a week from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM for face to face (F2F) instruction in compliance with social distancing guidelines. All other class meetings for the week will be online.\u00a0\nAttendance\nAttendance will be taken daily, for each class regardless of the option selected. Face to Face instruction is not required however, full participation from students is still expected online, in all classes. To be counted present, high school students are required to participate in online Zoom classes and/or complete a check-in assignment. Middle school students are required to be present and participate in the entire\u00a0 Zoom class meeting everyday for each block.\u00a0\nDaily Instruction\u00a0\nThe instructional day is from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM (in person and online). Students will attend classes by block according to their schedule. Teacher office hours are from 1:30 PM \u2013 3:00 PM. Teachers will be available to meet virtually with parents and students upon request.\u00a0\nGrading\nAll assignments will be graded and used to calculate final grades. At this time, state testing has not been waived for the upcoming school year. CSS will continue to prepare students for NC Check-ins, EOC and EOG assessments.\u00a0\u00a0\nDaily Schedule\nMiddle and high school will operate on a four block schedule of 60 minute classes with a 10 minute transition time between classes. There will be a 30 minute break after the second block.\u00a0\n\n\n\nClass Schedule: 8.00 AM \u2013 1:00 PM\n\n\n1st Block\n8:00 AM\u00a0 \u2013 9:00 AM\n\n\n2nd Block\n9:10 AM\u00a0 \u2013 10:10 AM\n\n\nLunch / Break\n10:20 AM\u00a0 \u2013 10:50 PM\n\n\n3rd Block\n10:50 AM\u00a0 \u2013 11:50 AM\n\n\n4th Block\n12: 00 PM\u00a0 \u2013 1.00 PM\n\n\n\nIn order for instructional time to be most effective and helpful to students, CSS needs to know which\u00a0 students are\u00a0 planning to be in the building for Face to Face learning days after the first two weeks of school.\u00a0 The form below must be completed by AUGUST 10, 2020. After August 10th, the opportunity to attend in-person (classroom) learning will be closed.

Our athletes are held the highest standards in the classroom, outside the school and during competition.\n\u200bCode of Conduct for Student-Athletes at Charlotte Secondary\n\nThe student-athlete shall keep academics as their number one priority.\nThe student-athlete shall play for the joy of the sport, the success of the team, and to win.\nThe student-athlete shall play hard, but fairly, always mindful of the rules and the spirit/intent of the rules. The student-athlete shall treat opponents with respect, shaking hands after all contests.\nThe student-athlete shall respect the judgment of contest officials and accept their decisions.\nThe student-athlete shall exhibit exemplary behavior, thus serving as a positive role model for teammates, opponents, and spectators.\nThe student-athlete shall accept the privileges and responsibilities of representing self, school and community.\u200b\n\nOur goal is to\u00a0 develop the total student-athlete.

Regulations: 34 CFR Part 99). This Act was designated to protect the privacy of educational records. Public School Units (PSUs) must annually notify parents and eligible students of their rights under FERPA 34 CFR \u00a7 99.7 which guides the sharing of student directory information and allows them the option to request that the school not disclose this information.\nBeginning in February, 2020, parents and guardians must make an intentional decision to opt-in or opt-out of the sharing of information. The purpose is to ensure parents and guardians are aware of opportunities available to them and to assist families with the updating of selections each year. When parents initially sign in to PowerSchool Parent Portal, they must choose if they desire to share student contact information per FERPA guidelines.

This atmosphere provides our students with a variety of experiential learning opportunities. As specified in our charter, we actively recruit students who thrive in a smaller school environment, as well as those who are traditionally under-represented in high school college preparatory programs.\nPrimarily a college and career preparatory school, we gather students from all educational backgrounds and provide them with avenues of enrichment and study that cater to their individual needs. Ultimately our charge is to guide all students in the discovery of their own particular genius, a crucial step in a distinctive life-path.\nOur History\nCharlotte Secondary School is a public charter school that opened in 2007 serving students in middle school grades 6-8. Recognized as a School of Distinction in 2011, the school moved to larger facility and expanded to grades 6-12 in 2014. Charlotte Secondary graduated the first senior class in 2016 with 32 of the 36 graduates enrolling in a 2 or 4-year college.\nOur current senior class exceeds the state average in all 4 college-readiness benchmarks measured by the ACT (English, Math, Reading and Science). Our students continue the tradition of academic excellence set by that first class.\nOur Mission\nWe are a diverse middle and high school community that focuses on college and career preparation and individually tailored learning opportunities to empower all students to reach their full potential.\nOur Vision\nCSS students will be critical thinkers and effective communicators, engaged citizens and life-long learners.\n \n Academics\n Our Leadership\n Our Faculty & Staff\n Board Members\n PTO\n Careers\n Frequently Asked Questions\n McKinney-Vento Act\n Attend Charlotte Secondary School\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

Our job will be to make classes engaging and informative while preparing students for their life after they graduate. Your job is to make sure the students are here on time each day.\nBecause we are concerned for your child\u2019s safety and well-being, we ask that you notify the school by phone the morning the student is absent no later than 10:00 AM. Failure to do this will result in the student receiving an absence being recorded as unexcused. Call 704-295-0137.\nExcused Absences limited to:\n\nIllness of the student\nMedical appointments\nDeath of an immediate family member\nCourt appearance\nBona fides religious observances\nApproved educational opportunities\n\nDocumentation of these instances is required through one of these methods: a parent\u2019s note to the attendance office, e-mail notification or fax within 5 days of the student\u2019s return. This documentation is required even if you have previously called the office about an absence, and it must be received within the 5-day period. When a student returns to school following an absence, the student is responsible for making up missed work.\nAs a public school, Charlotte Secondary is required to comply with North Carolina\u2019s Compulsory Attendance law (GS 115C\u2011378.) This law states that guardians are responsible for seeing that their children attend school each day it is in session and may be prosecuted in a criminal action if a student, under the age of 16, has multiple unlawful absences. A notification letter is sent by mail stating that legal action will be taken when a student has reached this absence level.\n \n Academic Calendar\n Attendance Policy\n School Lunch Program\n After School Program\n Parent & Family Engagement Policy\n Important Forms\n School Supplies List\n Volunteer Application\n Our Faculty & Staff\n Power School\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 3},

Our school receives funds from the federal government to help students improve in achievement. Title I money provides both extra teachers to work with children and additional funds to purchase materials, supplies, and training opportunities for staff and parents. The best education of students involves partnerships among the home, school, community, and other support agencies. The involvement of parents is important to the school community and to the success of our students. Parent involvement activities will be reviewed annually by parents.\u00a0 The goal is to ensure parents are involved in the planning and implementation of the Title I program at Charlotte Secondary School.\nAnnual Public Meetings\nAnnual Fall and Spring meetings occur to inform parents about parental involvement requirements, school performance, and methods for measuring progress, school facilities and the School-wide Title I program. At the end of the school year, input is solicited from parents to plan, evaluate, and improve the program for next year. Meetings are held throughout the year to train and involve parents in the education of their children. Quarterly meetings are held to enable parents to see our focus for learning, quarterly expectations and data review as well as to involved parents in celebrating the success of our students.\nRegular Meetings\nParents and students are encouraged to participate in Fall in order to gain information about the school\u2019s performance the previous year, and to discuss initiatives for improvement for the current year. Teachers and administrators schedule parent/student conference whenever deemed necessary by the school or when requested by the parents. These conferences are held before, during, or after school hours.\nFlexible Meetings\nRegular and scheduled parent meetings or conferences are held throughout the school year, at various times of the day, to provide continued information, support, and resources for parents. Parents are encouraged to volunteer and attend all school activities.\nInvolving Parents\nParents are encouraged to participate in school activities. Information shall be provided through workshops, family activities, special events, individual parent conferences, educational materials and literature available through school programs and at the school. The school\u2019s Student Assistance Team/ Multi-Tiered Support Team and IEP committees work with parents to assure parent training is adequate to assist their child with achievement strategies.\nParent Comments\nAt each meeting parents will be asked to participate in an evaluation in order that improvements may be made. Parents are also given surveys to complete. Parents and others may continuously provide input on any matter concerning our school. An open door policy prevails here at CSS. Parents are always welcome to share suggestions and comments with teachers, staff, and administration.\nParent Assistance\nState and local expectations are shared with parents at the Parent Information Meeting in the early Fall. EOG/EOC results are shared at the Fall and Spring Title I Annual Meetings. Results are shared in the school\u2019s newsletter and the principal\u2019s letter to our parent community. All grades are sent home interim progress reports, quarterly report cards and special letters, which indicate the child\u2019s progress.\u00a0 In conjunction with these progress reports, meetings are scheduled with parents to discuss specific concerns.\nOpportunities for LEP and SWD Parents\nAll parents are encouraged to attend school functions. Translators will be arranged for parents who speak languages other than English. Whenever possible, meetings are scheduled at the parent\u2019s convenience. Transportation can be arranged, if necessary.\nParents with Limited English Proficiency, Disabilities, Migratory children\nParents of children with limited English proficiency or disabilities are afforded opportunities to participate fully and freely in all education activities at school. Once the need is identified, assistance shall be provided. Whenever possible, information is sent home in native language. Bilingual staff members, parents, ESL instructors and even students are assigned as liaison between home and school. Charlotte Secondary School is handicap accessible.\nEducation of School Personnel\nSchool staff conducts ongoing reviews of student data to ensure timely reporting out of assessment data to the staff. This ensures the staff the tools to identify at-risk students and in turn, share this information with parents. On-going staff development initiatives are continually provided to the staff which focuses on effective communication with parents, establishing a school/family partnership, ways to involve parents, and suggestions for parents to work with children at home.\nInformation\nClassroom teachers and the administration send home notices on a regular basis, such as the Weekly Newsletter and Calendar, and progress reports, etc. Our school web page and the Power School Parent Portal are also tools for communication. Our ELL tutors and Spanish-Speaking staff are used to adapt communications for parents whose primary language is not English.\nCoordinating and Integrating With Other Programs\nCoordination with other programs is evident, starting with the school\u2019s Leadership Team.

It is important to remember, however, that every child\u2019s academic needs are different. And, because every school\u2019s programs and resources vary, parents and students should carefully evaluate a potential school to ensure a good fit between the child\u2019s abilities and the school\u2019s educational philosophy and curriculum. CSS strongly encourages parents to attend an Open House and review all prospective family materials.\n\n\n\nWhere do I get an application?\nApplications are available at the school, or you can download using the link below.\nOnce completed, applications can be dropped off or faxed to the school at 704-295-0156. All applications must be signed; we cannot accept an unsigned application, regardless of its delivery method. Applications will be date and time stamped when received. The Lottery will occur on\u00a0March 8, 2019.\u00a0 Applications received after this date will be placed on a waiting list in the order in which they are received.\n Download Student Application\n\n\n\nWhy Charlotte Secondary?\nCharlotte Secondary School knows that children don\u2019t all learn the same way. With individualized instruction, Charlotte Secondary School strives to ensure your child is academically challenged and successful while feeling comfortable in a diverse, safe and bully-free environment. Students actively engage in critical thought and participate in open and respectful discussions. With class sizes at a current 20:1 ratio, your child is guaranteed to receive individual attention and opportunities to academically shine.\nCSS is a great alternative for students who struggle in larger schools.\n\n\n\n\nCurriculum\n\nAre you a college prep school?\nCSS strives to prepare students for \u201cwhat\u2019s next.\u201d\nWe recognize education/schools as the preparation for all Americans to earn a decent livelihood, be a good citizen of the nation and the world, and make a good life for oneself. Our philosophy naturally builds a rigorous college preparatory program \u2013 including 2 and 4-year institutions. Students\u2019 intellectual as well as their ethical and moral growth and their sense of civic responsibility are developed and strengthened. The CSS philosophy supports students\u2019 academic and moral development as closely related skills necessary for developing an individual into an authentic, purposeful learner.\nIn short, we want to prepare our students for life after high school, whether it\u2019s college, community college, technical college or a career.\n\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of a charter school?\n\nImprove student learning\nIncrease learning opportunities for all students with special emphasis on expanded learning experiences for students who are identifies as at risk of academic failure or academically gifted\nEncourage the use of different and innovative teaching methods\nCreate new professional opportunities for teachers\nProvide parents and students with expanded choices\nHold the school accountable for meeting measurable student achievement results\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a charter school?\nCharter schools are public schools in that they:\n\nAre publicly funded through state and local tax revenue;\nDo not charge tuition;\nAre open to all North Carolina residents.\n\nUnlike traditional public schools, though, charter schools are operated by non-profit corporations and governed by the corporation\u2019s Board of Directors rather than the local school board. Also, charter schools are somewhat less regulated than traditional public schools. For example, NC charter schools have more flexibility than traditional public schools with respect to curriculum, teacher salaries and licensure requirements, specifications for school buildings, and purchasing.\nHowever, charter schools are subject to oversight by the State Board of Education and the NC Department of Public Instruction. Charter school facilities must meet all local health and safety requirements and charter school students must take the same end-of-grade and end-of-course tests as other public school students in North Carolina.\nStudents who attend charter schools do so by choice. Charter schools, often referred to as under-funded public schools, receive state and local funding on a per student basis as do traditional public schools. Unlike traditional public schools, charter schools receive no funding for buildings, equipment, campus improvements, technology, transportation, food service, or capital expenditures.\nCSS is a Title 1 school. Please see information below\nClick\u00a0here\u00a0to go to the National Charter School Resource Center website for more information about charter schools.\n\n\n\nWhat are your guiding principles?\nCharlotte Secondary School\u2019s core principles are as follows:\n\nA fundamental purpose of public education is to maintain and advance our democratic society\nA rigorous college preparatory education is the best preparation for civic participation, post-secondary education and the modern workplace\nDiversity is not merely desirable; it is necessary for the accomplishment of our mission\nA good education should be personalized and engage the whole person\nOur teachers will be competent, caring professionals who will grow along with our students\nFamily and community engagement is essential for academic achievement\nA school is always a work in progress; we will pursue continuous improvement through self-assessment and evidence-based practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Documents \n\n\n\nCSS at a Glance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPDF (2.6Mb)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSS at a Glance (ESP)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPDF (2.6Mb)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish Application\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPDF (1Mb)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpanish Application\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPDF (1Mb)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nQuestions?Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Name *FirstLastEmail *Comment or Message *PhoneSubmit \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 2},

These relationships will often prove crucial when a family needs access to services and resources to meet basic needs. Some places to start may include:\u00a0\ncommunity food pantries\u00a0local health services and professionals like dental, health, and mental health needs\u00a0local Boys and Girls Clubs, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, United Way, Salvation Army, and other shelter providers;\u00a0faith-based organizations; and\u00a0local businesses or organizations involved in community service. \u00a0\nDispute Resolution\u00a0\nThe following steps and procedures should take place in resolving disputes regarding enrollment, school placement, or services.\u00a0\nComplaint\u00a0\nA complaint is an oral or written and signed statement alleging the violation of a federal or state law, rule, or regulation. The complaint must allege a violation that occurred not more than one (1) year prior to the date that the complaint is received, unless a longer period is reasonable because the violation is considered systemic or ongoing. Parents, teachers, administrators, or other concerned individuals or organizations may file a complaint (\u201cComplainant\u201d). Faculty and staff with knowledge of a complaint must refer the Complainant to the Liaison. The Complainant may submit the complaint in writing to the Liaison, using the attached Complaint Resolution Initiation Form. The Complainant may choose to initiate the complaint orally.\u00a0\nRole of School\u00a0\nImmediately enroll the child in the school preferred by the person(s) bringing the complaint.\u00a0Provide all educational services for which the child is eligible, pending resolution of the dispute.\u00a0\nRole of Liaison\u00a0\nAfter receipt of the complaint, the Liaison must provide a written explanation of the school placement decision and/or provided services to the Complainant and discuss the complaint with the Complainant. The Liaison must provide a written proposed resolution or a plan of action to the Complainant within five (5) days of receipt of the complaint, or within seven (7) business days of notification of dispute (Georgia only).\u00a0If the Liaison does not resolve the dispute, the Complainant may forward it to the school principal.\u00a0The Liaison must provide a written resolution to the parties within five (5) days of the discussion with the principal, or within ten (10) business days of the second dispute (Georgia only). The Complainant has a right to obtain assistance from advocates or attorneys in addressing a complaintThe Liaison will carry out the dispute resolution in an expeditious manner and will provide the. Complainant these written procedures, including the appeal procedures outlined below.\u00a0In the event the school is unable to resolve the complaint, the Complainant may pursue the applicable appeal procedure(s).\u00a0\n\nAppeal Procedures \u2013 North Carolina\n\nIf the dispute is not resolved at the school level, the Complainant may direct the complaint, orally or written, to the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction.\u00a0\nAddress the complaint to the following address:\u00a0\n\nState Coordinator for Homeless Education, National Center for Homeless Education, SERVE Center at UNCG, 5900 Summit Avenue, Ste. 201, Browns Summit, NC 27214.\u00a0\nThe complaint should include:\u00a0\nthe name, address, and telephone number of the person filing the appeal;\u00a0the relationship or connection of the person to the child in question;\u00a0the name and age of the child involved;\u00a0the name of the school and school personnel involved in the complaint;\u00a0the federal requirement alleged to have been violated; a description of the situation that prompted the complaint;\u00a0a description of the attempts that were made to solve the issue;\u00a0supporting documentation; and\u00a0the relief the person is seeking.\u00a0\nThe Liaison will provide the State Homeless Coordinator with any information that the State Homeless Coordinator requests regarding the issues presented in the appeal.\u00a0\nThe State Homeless Coordinator will provide the school and the Complainant the opportunity to respond to any decision made and to provide any additional evidence the Complainant deems relevant.\u00a0\nWithin 10 school days following receipt of the complete appeal, the State Coordinator shall issue a final written decision to the school and the Complainant.\u00a0\nThe Liaison will provide the Complainant an acknowledgement of receipt of the Form Petition and will transmit the Form Petition g the school and receiving transportation services until the Commissioner issues an appeal decision.\u00a0\n\nProfessional Development\u00a0\nLiaison Training\u00a0\nSince ESSA took effect, many states now require Homeless Liaisons to complete training and have a certificate of completion on file. While NHA provides staff training on homeless awareness through OnCourse, the Homeless Liaison at each school should complete the state specific training available and the NCHE Webinars.\u00a0\nStart Professional Development\u00a0\nHomeless Liaisons have a huge role helping so many families and students, but identification of homeless students should not rest on the Liaison alone. All staff at your school may be trained on how to identify homeless students and how to notify the Homeless Liaison of potential homeless students. Federal and state legislation require the Homeless Liaison to conduct staff trainings on these topics annually. This can be accomplished at a staff meeting and documentation such as the agenda or any sign in sheets should be kept as evidence for potential audits. Be sure to take advantage of the readily available presentations located on the NCHE site, or reach out to your State Coordinator for additional resources.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 2},

Isn't it a public school?\nSocrates Academy is indeed a public school, but it is also a charter school.\u00a0 Each year, North Carolina charter schools receive a fixed, per-pupil stipend from state and local government sources, which doesn't include funding for a building, bus services or salary increases for teachers with advanced degrees.\u00a0 Socrates Academy must finance facilities expenditures out of general operating revenues, privately raised funds, or partnerships with other organizations. In other words, if we want to purchase or build a new facility, we need to raise those dollars ourselves.\n\u00a0\n\u200b\nWhat is the difference between Annual Funds and Capital Funds?\nAnnual funds are used for operational costs at a school, such as salaries, enrichments, maintenance and supplies. While Capital funds are used for \"brick and mortar type projects\".\u00a0 North Carolina charter schools only receive operations funding, NOT capital funding. Money for building must come from donations or private borrowing.\n\u00a0\n\u200b\nAre we seeking support from outside the school community?\nExternal support will be critical in our effort to raise sufficient funds necessary to purchase the land for our middle school and to build a new building. However, when outside sources are approached, the first question that they ask is \"What have you been able to raise internally?\"\u00a0 It is most important right now that we achieve our goal of 100% participation so that we can better leverage our case outside of our school community. The Fundraising Committee will continue to explore potential donors outside of our internal school community.\n\u00a0\n\u200b\nHow will my funds be used?\nDonations to the Socrates Academy Capital Campaign are used to enhance and grow the school\u2019s infrastructure and campus. In the past, the Capital Campaign has helped the school purchase additional land, construct our Middle School facility, and build an all new 4th and 5th grade facility.\n\u00a0\n\u200b\nWhat is a Matching Gift Program?\nWhen a company or corporation offers gift matching it means when an employee makes a charitable contribution to a non-profit organization, the corporation agrees to pay an equal amount to the same non-profit organization.\n\u00a0\nFor example, if you are an employee of Wells Fargo, you could donate $50.00 to Socrates Academy monthly by bank draft, and Wells Fargo would donate the same amount. That would mean Socrates Academy would receive $100.00 monthly, resulting in a $1200.00 a year!\nClick here to see a list of companies\u00a0we know that DO have Matching Gift programs\n\u00a0\nContact Us\nIf you have any question about the Foundation, fundraising or would like additional information about upcoming initiatives, please feel free to contact us at:\nfoundation@socratesacademy.us\n\u00a0\nSocrates Academy Foundation\n3909 Weddington Road\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704-321-1711 X138Contact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.\nMatthews, NC 28105\n704.321.1711\nFax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

From the moment your child's name is drawn in the enrollment lottery, Socrates Academy\u00a0provides an exceptional range of opportunities for you to engage with their learning experience. We offer opportunities for HomeBase Parents to assist in the classroom.\u00a0Beyond\u00a0the classroom, parents can engage with school clubs to share a love of chess, journalism, or their personal area of expertise.\n\u00a0\nOur commitment to keeping parents fully informed and engaged is reflected in this website. Here you will find information on past and upcoming events, teacher pages with updates on the latest happenings in the classroom and the extended learning that our scholars bring home, and contact information for your child's teachers. The school site includes printable forms, links to hot lunch ordering, up-to-date information on school procedures, and timely updates on school closures.\n\u00a0\nIn a partnership, the flow of information goes both ways and we value parent input as an integral component of our ongoing development. Through the PFI and regular Town Hall meetings, we invite you to play an active role in defining the future direction of the Socrates Academy community.\n\u00a0\nWe are thrilled that you and your children have joined the Socrates Academy community.

Today we would like to announce that CSS will go to FULL REMOTE learning starting on August 17, 2020.\u00a0 We have been working diligently over the summer to come up with the safest & healthiest way to begin this school year and had hoped that we would be welcoming students & staff into the building. With CMS deciding last week to go completely remote, we feel at this time that CSS should follow Plan C as well to ensure the safety of our students and staff.\nWe still have quite a few details to work out and will update you as soon as we can. We are planning an Open House of sorts and appreciate your patience with us as we continue to plan for this school year.\nThank you.\nAttendance\nAttendance will be taken daily, for each class. Full participation from students is expected online in all classes. To be counted present, high school students are required to participate in online Zoom classes and/or complete a check-in assignment. Middle school students are required to be present and participate in the entire\u00a0 Zoom class meeting everyday for each block.\nDaily Instruction\nThe instructional day is from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM (online).\u00a0 Students will attend classes by block according to their schedule. Teacher office hours are from 1:30 PM \u2013 3:00 PM. Teachers will be available to meet virtually with parents and students upon request.\nGrading\nAll assignments will be graded and used to calculate final grades. At this time, state testing has not been waived\u00a0 for the upcoming school year.\u00a0 CSS will continue to prepare students for NC Check-ins, EOC and EOG assessments.\nDaily Schedule\nMiddle and high school will operate on a four block schedule of 60 minute classes with a 10 minute transition time between classes.
