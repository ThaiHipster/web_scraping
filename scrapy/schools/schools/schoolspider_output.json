Particular emphasis is placed on developing proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics both in English and Greek through the use of the Socratic Method.\u200bOur Core ValuesOur vibrant school community embodies the following values:\u2022 Filotimo (Greek: \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf): \u0391lmost impossible to translate sufficiently, as it describes a complex array of virtues that encompass honor, dignity and pride; to always act with righteousness, integrity, and honor.\u2022 Arete (Greek: \u0391\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae): Excellence of any kind and moral virtue. Fulfillment of purpose or function: the act of living up to one's full potential.\u2022 Philoxenia (Greek: \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03be\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03b1): eagerness to show hospitality\u2022 Ethos (Greek: \u0397\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2): Ethical Behavior\u2022 Personal Responsibility: Each person is accountable for their actions and the welfare of their community.\u2022 Empathy and Kindness: Engaging in cognitive, emotional, and compassionate understanding of others and responding with kindness.\u2022 Respect of Diversity, Equity, and Justice\u2022 Moral Courage: Doing what is right and leading by example\u2022 Strive for Excellence (Greek: \u0391\u03b9\u03ad\u03bd \u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd): Setting goals and always striving to do one\u2019s best and seeking continuous improvement\u200b\u200bThe Socrates ApproachThe Academy\u2019s multilingual, multicultural curriculum follows both the North Carolina Essential Standards and Common Core (language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, physical education, art, and music) and the National Greek Curriculum Standards (language arts, mathematics, and Greek culture).\u00a0Instruction relies on the Socratic Method to foster critical analytical thinking. The program is characterized by high academic quality with a special emphasis in mathematics, reading, writing, character development, multiculturalism, and early learning of a second and third language.\u00a0\u00a0What is the Socratic Method?Definition:the use of questions as employed by Socrates to develop a latent idea, as in the mind of a pupil, or to elicit admissions, as from an opponent,tending to establish a proposition.\u00a0The Socratic Method is the oldest, and still the most powerful, teaching tactic for fostering critical thinking. It is also know as inquiry-based teaching. In Socratic teaching we focus on giving students questions, not answers. We model an inquiring, probing mind by continually probing into the subject with questions. Questions are used to arouse curiosity and at the same time serve as a logical, incremental, step-wise guide that enables students to figure out about a complex topic or issue with their own thinking and insights.\u00a0The Socratic method is an integral part of instruction at Socrates Academy.\u00a0 This method of thought and analysis has been in use since the time of the ancient Greeks and has been recognized as not only an effective teaching tool, but also an engaging way for students to take an active role in their own education.\u00a0Want to learn more about how the Socratic Method works in the classroom?\u00a0Read more >>BITMOJI VIRTUAL OPEN HOUSEGet to know our teacher and our campus with this fun interactive presentation.

Elementary classes prepare Socrates students for the academic variety and rigor of the middle school curriculum, and upon graduating to middle school, students have a balanced mix of responsibilities and freedoms that result in opportunities for students to establish their own independence.

I continue to be amazed at the dedication of our staff and hard work of our scholars. From Socratic Seminars in 8th grade to Number Detectives in 1st grade, our teachers are engaging scholars in creative ways each day. We miss our scholars and cannot wait until the day they return to the building. But, in the meantime, we are committed to delivering excellence virtually.It is important to note that our teachers are reflecting each day on instruction and scholar needs. Teachers meet multiple times a week to collaboratively plan and analyze student progress. As we progress with remote learning, we will continue to evaluate our strengths and opportunities for improvement. One area we continue to evaluate is our K-4 Special Area classes. Feedback received in the summer was that many parents were concerned about screen time and lengthy school days. Special area classes were designated for one day a week in grades K-4 to reduce screen time and prevent a longer day. Parents have the option to structure the specials day in whatever manner meets the needs of your scholar. Scholars can complete the specials just as scheduled on their assigned day or alternatively, they can complete their specials throughout the week. Going forward, specials will be posted on the grade level weekly planner. Scholars will have until Friday to complete their special area assignments. Some have asked why we continue with special area classes during remote learning. Special area classes are not filler classes. Instead, each class serves a purpose to help our scholars meet standards in the areas of information and technology, physical education, literacy, and the arts. For many scholars, they look forward to these classes and it provides a creative outlet for them to excel. Soon the special area team will begin hosting live sessions for scholars to join and complete activities. Look for more information to come about this exciting event. Contact the special area teacher if you have any questions or concerns regarding the schedule or expectations:Myles Pearl, PE - mpearl@socratesacademy.usAlex Keilen, Technology - akeilen@socratesacademy.usSue Mabon, Library - smabon@socratesacademy.usCarolyn Decker, Music - cdecker@socratesacademy.usKaren Peyton, Art - kpeyton@socratesacademy.us *Special area teachers can also be messaged through Class Dojo messenger.Collaboration between teacher and parent is vital to the success of our scholars. I encourage you to reach out to your scholar\u2019s teacher(s) if you have any questions or concerns. If they can\u2019t help you, they will connect you with the person who can help you. Please make sure you are connected to all of our information platforms - Class Dojo, our website, our Facebook page, and through our weekly Socrates Connection newsletter.

There are a lot of different opinions on how to return to learning this month. About the only thing we can all agree on is that no one is going to be happy with how this school year is starting.We get it. Distance learning doesn\u2019t replace being in a classroom and is a struggle for parents, students, and teachers. At the same time, many educators and parents share concerns about the potential for the spread of COVID-19 at schools.The tough decisions on how communities are returning to schools are being made by your local school leaders under the requirements set forth by Governor Cooper and his team. Every school faces unique challenges that reflect the uniqueness of each community, so different decisions will be made for different communities. Currently, two out of three of North Carolina\u2019s students will start this school year with distance learning.At your NC Department of Public Instruction, we have been supporting local schools and communities by providing multiple strategies on how schools can meet the COVID-19 requirements for in-person learning. We have worked closely with local districts to strengthen distance learning so that it is improved from what students, parents, and teachers faced at the end of last school year. It still will not be perfect, but it will be better and specifically should have more live interactions with teachers, even if over video chats. Please click here to visit our resource page for parents and teachers.Please join us as we work to help encourage each other and our students. We can all agree that no one is happy that COVID-19 has created obstacles unlike any we have ever faced. We don\u2019t have to agree on everything after that, but let\u2019s work together, with grace and encouragement, to overcome the challenges ahead.Sincerely,Mark Johnson NC Superintendent of Public Instruction @MarkRJohnsonNCContact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\u00a0", "depth": 1},

There continues to be wide community spread of COVID-19 in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg County area. The CDC has updated their guidance to clarify mitigation strategies based on level of community transmission of COVID-19. It suggests additional strategies \u201c...be considered when there is substantial transmission in the local community\u2026.\u201d including the extension of schools offering distance learning. Three in four cases of COVID-19 occur in individuals ages 20-59. This put a majority of our staff population at risk.While our Board initially voted in favor of Plan B\u2019s hybrid approach to opening, which would have included both in-person and remote instruction, that plan was contingent on having enough teacher support to provide high quality, grade level appropriate instruction to scholars while on campus.  An overwhelming majority of our teachers either cannot return to in-person instruction or are uncomfortable doing so, given the current metrics.  We are concerned about the quality of instruction that would be offered with less than 30% of the teaching staff available or if teachers are pressured to teach in person, against their own wishes.  Accordingly, without sufficient teacher support for the hybrid plan, the Board of Directors has approved our school year to start with remote learning. This decision will be reviewed by October 29, 2020 [the end of 1st quarter].  Our decision to return and the flexibility that will be offered to scholars and teachers desiring to continue with remote learning will be based on the metrics in our community at that time.  We are working through what those benchmarks will be and will communicate them for your planning purposes.More information will come in the following days about our distance learning program.  We are working to ensure that it is more rigorous than what we were forced into in the Spring, while at the same time taking into account families\u2019 schedules and the mental health needs of our scholars. We understand that these are challenging times. It is difficult when we must consider modifying our course of action.

For example, K-2 students begin on November 3rd, NOT November 2nd.Carpool Tag Pick-up & Supply Drop OffFamilies will be given numbers instead of names for carpool this year. Staff working the carpool line will enter the number into a tablet and the name will be displayed on a screen in the child\u2019s classroom. You MUST have a new sign to go through carpool.\u200bMasks & Temperature ChecksPlease make sure that all occupants in the car are wearing a mask when you stop in the car circle for drop off. Please keep heat low to prevent false temperature readings. Pull to a spot marked by a cone and wait until a staff member opens the door. Do not drop off on your own.\u00a0\u00a0You will be asked three questions by a staff member:\u00a0Has your child been a close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes without a mask) in the last 14 days with someone diagnosed with Covid 19 or has the health department told them to quarantine?Does your child have any of these symptoms: fever, chills, shortness of breath, cough, loss of taste/smell?Does your child have Co vid 19?\u200bIf you answer 'Yes' to any of the questions, your student and all other family members cannot come to school. If you answer 'No', the staff member will check your child's temperature. If it is 100.4 or higher, your child and all other family members cannot come to school. If it is close to 100.4 we may ask you to pull to the side parking lot, wait a few minutes, and then we will re-check it.\u200bNo Walkers - Morning or AfternoonIn an effort to limit exposure we are not allowing visitors on campus which means students who qualify as Walkers by living less than a mile from the school, must be dropped off or picked up during carpool ONLY.\u00a0Late Pick-UpsStudents waiting on parents who are late will not be sent to Afterschool as was done previously. Late Parents will need to park, call the office and walk to the doors, where the student will be waiting. After 3 late pick ups, students will be asked to move to Remote Instruction.HYBRID CALENDAR DOWNLOADBRING YOUR OWN DEVICE AGREEMENTREOPENING TRANSITION PLANMOVE TO REMOTEHYBRID PLAN PARENT HANDBOOKFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSASK A QUESTIONPROCEDURE VIDEOS\u200b\u200bSocial Distance Tour >>\u00a0Wear a Mask >>Ducks in a Row - Campus Walks >>Recess Before/After Procedures >>Arrive to Classroom in Morning >>\u00a0Feeling Sick Procedure >>\u200bMorning Carpool >>\u200bAfternoon Carpool >>ELEMENTARYBELL SCHEDULE\u00a0ARRIVAL:\u00a0 \u00a07:45am - 8:10amTARDY AFTER:\u00a0 \u00a08:10am\u200bHow to Sign In a Tardy StudentStudents who are tardy will need to be checked in by a parent in the Middle School Foyer.

To learn more about ways to volunteer, contact jsoucey@socratesacademy.us\u00a0\u200bWhat happens if I don't volunteer?Our volunteer commitment is listed in our charter, which means we can be turned down for Charter Renewal or lose the Charter that we have\u200b if we do not meet our volunteer requirements as a school.\u00a0\u200bWhy do I have to volunteer?North Carolina charter schools receive state and federal funding for each student. However, state educational funding across North Carolina has declined year over year since 2009, and total funding for charters is still significantly less than for public schools.\u00a0Charter schools do not receive a share of the North Carolina Lottery money earmarked for education.Charter schools do not receive state or federal funding for purchase or maintenance of facilities.\u00a0In order for Socrates Academy to continue to provide an exceptional educational experience for all of our scholars, we must seek creative ways to bridge that gap. Volunteering makes a huge difference in this area, while increasing family engagement in the school and strengthening the Socrates community. This is why the volunteer requirement is included in the enrollment paperwork for all Socrates scholars.\u200bHow many hours do I have to complete?36 Volunteer Hours are required from each family that attends Socrates Academy.\u200b\u00a0What constitutes a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?A volunteer hour is an hour spent at the request of the school (Administration, teachers, BOD, Foundation, PFI) engaged in an activity in support of the school mission.\u00a0 Examples include:\u00a0Participating in Committee workAttending Town Hall meetings or Board MeetingsPlanning, setting up and/or breaking down for meetingsWork for school at home (worksheet cut outs, scholastic flyers, etc)Working a special eventFulfilling duties for committees\u00a0What does not\u00a0constitute a Socrates Academy volunteer hour?Eating lunch with your scholarAttending parent/teacher conferences\u00a0Can other family members, (Grandparents, Siblings, Aunt or Uncles) volunteer?We love to see the whole family involved with the school. Additional family members are welcome to volunteer their time and talents with us. We are appreciative of each and every hour they volunteer.\u200bCan I donate my hours?Yes. If you have additional hours, please log them either in a friends name, or in your own name. At the end of the year all of the hours are totaled and averaged together.\u00a0\u200bHow will my hours be tracked?Use the volunteer log on the website to track your hours. You are now unable to search your hours online. We are looking at solutions, but for now, please make sure your email address is correct when you log your hours, because totals will be sent there. Please use the same email address each time you fill out the volunteer log.\u200b\u200b\u00a0\u00a0Contact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\u00a0", "depth": 1},

All grades use this space for lunches, performances, after school events and dances.1/17Frequently Asked Questions\u200bHow does the lottery work?The date, time and place of the lottery will be communicated to all applicants. The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn.Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn.\u200bApplications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a \"first come, first served\" basis.\u200bWhat is Siblings Preference?Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time.\u00a0When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list.\u00a0PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend.\u00a0If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately.\u00a0If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery?No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. \u200bDo I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in?No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement.\u00a0Will you give me my child\u2019s number ahead of time?No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery.\u00a0Do siblings automatically get in?Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list.\u00a0If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified?We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email.\u00a0\u00a0Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision?No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school.\u00a0How will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school?Your acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email.\u00a0Will results be posted online?No. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons.\u00a0How does the lottery work if you have twins?Twins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school.\u00a0\u00a0If I\u2019m on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in?You will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child.\u00a0How are the accepted lottery applicants determined?The lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants.\u00a0My child wasn\u2019t selected in this year\u2019s lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply?Yes. Each time you wish for your child\u2019s name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application.\u00a0Can I submit my child\u2019s application even if he does not meet the state age requirement?No. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for.\u00a0I applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement?Only students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement.\u00a0What if I don\u2019t have all of my paperwork to submit with the application?Student applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery.\u00a0What if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply?Any applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received.\u00a0Can I call the school to get my lottery results?We ask that you check your email before calling the school. Results will not be given over the phone\u00a0\u00a0Can I have someone else pick up my lottery results?Lottery results will only be provided to a parent or guardian.\u200b\u200b\u00a0Contact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\u00a0", "depth": 1},

An alternative to bringing lunch is to order from our Hot Lunch Menu. Hot Lunch is prepared off site and brought in to the scholars and must be ordered 2-4 weeks in advance. Learn more about Hot Lunch HERE.\u00a0Students walk from their classroom to lunch each day with their class and eat in the cafeteria with their teacher.\u00a0Students are not permitted to share food.\u00a0Students are not permitted to bring soda in their lunches.\u00a0Students may not be pulled from class during instruction to have lunch with a sibling unless their lunch schedule is the same.\u00a0The Discipline Policy/Code of Conduct applies to all student actions during lunch\u00a0Socrates Academy provides a table in the cafeteria that is to be kept free of the type of allergen(s) that impact theidentified student(s).

Students are taught to check the stage for their lunch before calling home.\u00a0If a student has forgotten their lunch and a parent is unable to be reached, they are able to buy lunch with credit from the Hot Lunch counter. The student will need to bring cash money for payment the next day.VISITING DURING LUNCHAny family members visiting during lunch, must sign in with a license at either office. Please meet your child in the cafeteria, not in the classroom.\u00a0\u00a0We ask that parents do not join younger students for lunch during the first two weeks of school, as it can be upsetting to the student when the family member leaves after lunch.\u200bIf a parent wishes to send in a treat for their child\u2019s birthday, they may coordinate with the homeroom teacher about a time for the treat to be brought to school. It is the policy of Socrates Academy that all food provided for consumption of our scholars must be commercially prepared, with the ingredient label visible. Our allergy management policy can be found HERE\u200bVolunteers are needed to work behind the Hot Lunch counter and also in the main cafeteria area.

I am grateful to have the opportunity to lead a school with such determined students, a dedicated staff, and a supportive school community.\u00a0 I feel honored to be part of this school and to support the students and families.\u00a0My official start date at CSS is Monday, August 17th, so our students and I will have the same first day. Rest assured that I am working with the board and Ms. Garrison to make this transition as smooth as possible.I have been devoted to educating students for eighteen years, working with students ranging in age from 6th through 12th grade in various roles. I started my education career as a middle school counselor, test coordinator, cheer, and softball coach. During this time I worked to make sure that students were growing academically, personally, and socially. After several years in this role, I became interested in what my students were learning and how they learned. This is when I made the switch to school administration; I wanted to focus on the best ways to help students master the curriculum and be successful in the classroom setting. I moved on to become an Assistant Principal at Cary High School for eight years. Most recently, I served as the Instructional Vice Principal at Davis Middle School in Waldorf, Maryland. I am elated to bring my skills as an educational leader to Charlotte Secondary and to collaborate with you as a partner in education to ensure your child\u2019s success.I view education as a life-long learning process for students, parents, and faculty alike and look forward to the greatness that will come from the CSS family. More importantly, I bring a belief that students are at the center of all school-related decisions an should be considered in every choice that we make. \u00a0I am excited to unite my experience, my openness to learn, and my child-centered approach to support our students.\u00a0 Because the relationships between families and the school are vital to the success of our students, I encourage you to become involved in every way possible.\u00a0 I look forward to meeting you soon! \u00a0In closing, please know that my door is always open to you. I heartily welcome your conversation and positive input throughout this year. Let us always keep our students the primary focus of our work. I look forward to celebrating our collective successes during the 2020-2021 school year.Sincerely,Keisha C.

Dear Socrates Academy Families and Friends,  Thank you for your ongoing support to the Socrates Academy Annual Fund! Your Annual Fund Gift will have a positive and meaningful impact on the lives of our Socrates Scholars. Will you please join the many parents, staff, and board members who have already contributed to this year\u2019s campaign? Your support will enhance and expand educational opportunities for scholars at our National Blue Ribbon School, one of the top 1% schools in the United States! Your donation can make our great school even better. Here are the three top areas we hope to improve in 2018-2019 using your Annual Fund donations:  1) Technology in the classroom - We strive to educate our scholars in all grades using the latest technology. To do so, we aim to update 240 student laptops this year to newer models.  2) Teaching Success \u2013 Ongoing professional development ensures our teachers are engaged and equipped with up-to-date knowledge and practices in the classroom. We invest in our staff, significantly beyond what is required by the state of North Carolina, to create a dynamic, 21st century learning environment for our scholars. Additionally, beginning teachers at Socrates Academy receive professional support and guidance from an assigned mentor. These veteran teachers invest tremendous time and energy as mentors and play a vital role in the development and retention of talented new teachers. We would like to provide these mentors with an additional stipend to reflect the lasting value they pass on to the school and our scholars.  3) Hitting the Books \u2013 A strong foundation in reading is a key building block towards long-term academic success. We plan to purchase a diverse range of reading materials to be used every day in grades K-3, the foundational years in which student learn how to read. A classroom library that is well-stocked with a wide selection of diverse trade books will enhance their exposure to all genres and make more proficient readers.  Today, charter schools like Socrates Academy receive considerable less per-pupil revenue than district-run traditional public schools. In order to overcome this funding gap and continue to offer award-winning educational and extracurricular programs, Socrates Academy must maintain a supplemental stream of revenue. We\u2019re reaching out to ask for your participation and support again this year. Your donation will be used to support our 2018-2019 goals and will have a direct impact on our school\u2019s success.

The complaint must allege a violation that occurred not more than one (1) year prior to the date that the complaint is received, unless a longer period is reasonable because the violation is considered systemic or ongoing. Parents, teachers, administrators, or other concerned individuals or organizations may file a complaint (\u201cComplainant\u201d). Faculty and staff with knowledge of a complaint must refer the Complainant to the Liaison. The Complainant may submit the complaint in writing to the Liaison, using the attached Complaint Resolution Initiation Form.

While NHA provides staff training on homeless awareness through OnCourse, the Homeless Liaison at each school should complete the state specific training available and the NCHE Webinars.\u00a0Start Professional Development\u00a0Homeless Liaisons have a huge role helping so many families and students, but identification of homeless students should not rest on the Liaison alone. All staff at your school may be trained on how to identify homeless students and how to notify the Homeless Liaison of potential homeless students. Federal and state legislation require the Homeless Liaison to conduct staff trainings on these topics annually. This can be accomplished at a staff meeting and documentation such as the agenda or any sign in sheets should be kept as evidence for potential audits. Be sure to take advantage of the readily available presentations located on the NCHE site, or reach out to your State Coordinator for additional resources.\u00a0\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary SchoolSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design Back to top", "depth": 2},

Our school receives funds from the federal government to help students improve in achievement. Title I money provides both extra teachers to work with children and additional funds to purchase materials, supplies, and training opportunities for staff and parents. The best education of students involves partnerships among the home, school, community, and other support agencies. The involvement of parents is important to the school community and to the success of our students. Parent involvement activities will be reviewed annually by parents.\u00a0 The goal is to ensure parents are involved in the planning and implementation of the Title I program at Charlotte Secondary School.Annual Public MeetingsAnnual Fall and Spring meetings occur to inform parents about parental involvement requirements, school performance, and methods for measuring progress, school facilities and the School-wide Title I program. At the end of the school year, input is solicited from parents to plan, evaluate, and improve the program for next year. Meetings are held throughout the year to train and involve parents in the education of their children. Quarterly meetings are held to enable parents to see our focus for learning, quarterly expectations and data review as well as to involved parents in celebrating the success of our students.Regular MeetingsParents and students are encouraged to participate in Fall in order to gain information about the school\u2019s performance the previous year, and to discuss initiatives for improvement for the current year. Teachers and administrators schedule parent/student conference whenever deemed necessary by the school or when requested by the parents. These conferences are held before, during, or after school hours.Flexible MeetingsRegular and scheduled parent meetings or conferences are held throughout the school year, at various times of the day, to provide continued information, support, and resources for parents. Parents are encouraged to volunteer and attend all school activities.Involving ParentsParents are encouraged to participate in school activities. Information shall be provided through workshops, family activities, special events, individual parent conferences, educational materials and literature available through school programs and at the school. The school\u2019s Student Assistance Team/ Multi-Tiered Support Team and IEP committees work with parents to assure parent training is adequate to assist their child with achievement strategies.Parent CommentsAt each meeting parents will be asked to participate in an evaluation in order that improvements may be made. Parents are also given surveys to complete. Parents and others may continuously provide input on any matter concerning our school. An open door policy prevails here at CSS. Parents are always welcome to share suggestions and comments with teachers, staff, and administration.Parent AssistanceState and local expectations are shared with parents at the Parent Information Meeting in the early Fall. EOG/EOC results are shared at the Fall and Spring Title I Annual Meetings. Results are shared in the school\u2019s newsletter and the principal\u2019s letter to our parent community. All grades are sent home interim progress reports, quarterly report cards and special letters, which indicate the child\u2019s progress.\u00a0 In conjunction with these progress reports, meetings are scheduled with parents to discuss specific concerns.Opportunities for LEP and SWD ParentsAll parents are encouraged to attend school functions. Translators will be arranged for parents who speak languages other than English. Whenever possible, meetings are scheduled at the parent\u2019s convenience. Transportation can be arranged, if necessary.Parents with Limited English Proficiency, Disabilities, Migratory childrenParents of children with limited English proficiency or disabilities are afforded opportunities to participate fully and freely in all education activities at school. Once the need is identified, assistance shall be provided. Whenever possible, information is sent home in native language. Bilingual staff members, parents, ESL instructors and even students are assigned as liaison between home and school. Charlotte Secondary School is handicap accessible.Education of School PersonnelSchool staff conducts ongoing reviews of student data to ensure timely reporting out of assessment data to the staff. This ensures the staff the tools to identify at-risk students and in turn, share this information with parents. On-going staff development initiatives are continually provided to the staff which focuses on effective communication with parents, establishing a school/family partnership, ways to involve parents, and suggestions for parents to work with children at home.InformationClassroom teachers and the administration send home notices on a regular basis, such as the Weekly Newsletter and Calendar, and progress reports, etc. Our school web page and the Power School Parent Portal are also tools for communication. Our ELL tutors and Spanish-Speaking staff are used to adapt communications for parents whose primary language is not English.Coordinating and Integrating With Other ProgramsCoordination with other programs is evident, starting with the school\u2019s Leadership Team. Emphasis shall be placed on collaboration with Before and After School Tutoring as well as Summer Programs.

The CSS philosophy supports students\u2019 academic and moral development as closely related skills necessary for developing an individual into an authentic, purposeful learner.In short, we want to prepare our students for life after high school, whether it\u2019s college, community college, technical college or a career.What is the purpose of a charter school?Improve student learningIncrease learning opportunities for all students with special emphasis on expanded learning experiences for students who are identifies as at risk of academic failure or academically giftedEncourage the use of different and innovative teaching methodsCreate new professional opportunities for teachersProvide parents and students with expanded choicesHold the school accountable for meeting measurable student achievement resultsWhat is a charter school?Charter schools are public schools in that they:Are publicly funded through state and local tax revenue;Do not charge tuition;Are open to all North Carolina residents.Unlike traditional public schools, though, charter schools are operated by non-profit corporations and governed by the corporation\u2019s Board of Directors rather than the local school board. Also, charter schools are somewhat less regulated than traditional public schools. For example, NC charter schools have more flexibility than traditional public schools with respect to curriculum, teacher salaries and licensure requirements, specifications for school buildings, and purchasing.However, charter schools are subject to oversight by the State Board of Education and the NC Department of Public Instruction. Charter school facilities must meet all local health and safety requirements and charter school students must take the same end-of-grade and end-of-course tests as other public school students in North Carolina.Students who attend charter schools do so by choice. Charter schools, often referred to as under-funded public schools, receive state and local funding on a per student basis as do traditional public schools. Unlike traditional public schools, charter schools receive no funding for buildings, equipment, campus improvements, technology, transportation, food service, or capital expenditures.CSS is a Title 1 school.

Its mission is to act as the fundraising arm of the Socrates Academy. All programs, projects and activities funded through the Foundation shall be used to enhance the Academy's educational programs and will be in alignment with its strategic plan, mission statement, goals, and budget considerations.

Isn't it a public school?Socrates Academy is indeed a public school, but it is also a charter school.\u00a0 Each year, North Carolina charter schools receive a fixed, per-pupil stipend from state and local government sources, which doesn't include funding for a building, bus services or salary increases for teachers with advanced degrees.\u00a0 Socrates Academy must finance facilities expenditures out of general operating revenues, privately raised funds, or partnerships with other organizations. In other words, if we want to purchase or build a new facility, we need to raise those dollars ourselves.\u00a0\u200bWhat is the difference between Annual Funds and Capital Funds?Annual funds are used for operational costs at a school, such as salaries, enrichments, maintenance and supplies. While Capital funds are used for \"brick and mortar type projects\".\u00a0 North Carolina charter schools only receive operations funding, NOT capital funding. Money for building must come from donations or private borrowing.\u00a0\u200bAre we seeking support from outside the school community?External support will be critical in our effort to raise sufficient funds necessary to purchase the land for our middle school and to build a new building. However, when outside sources are approached, the first question that they ask is \"What have you been able to raise internally?\"\u00a0 It is most important right now that we achieve our goal of 100% participation so that we can better leverage our case outside of our school community. The Fundraising Committee will continue to explore potential donors outside of our internal school community.\u00a0\u200bHow will my funds be used?Donations to the Socrates Academy Capital Campaign are used to enhance and grow the school\u2019s infrastructure and campus. In the past, the Capital Campaign has helped the school purchase additional land, construct our Middle School facility, and build an all new 4th and 5th grade facility.\u00a0\u200bWhat is a Matching Gift Program?When a company or corporation offers gift matching it means when an employee makes a charitable contribution to a non-profit organization, the corporation agrees to pay an equal amount to the same non-profit organization.\u00a0For example, if you are an employee of Wells Fargo, you could donate $50.00 to Socrates Academy monthly by bank draft, and Wells Fargo would donate the same amount. That would mean Socrates Academy would receive $100.00 monthly, resulting in a $1200.00 a year!Click here to see a list of companies\u00a0we know that DO have Matching Gift programs\u00a0Contact UsIf you have any question about the Foundation, fundraising or would like additional information about upcoming initiatives, please feel free to contact us at:foundation@socratesacademy.us\u00a0Socrates Academy Foundation3909 Weddington RoadMatthews, NC 28105704-321-1711 X138Contact UsHOME\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 CAREERS \u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.Matthews, NC 28105704.321.1711Fax: 704.321.1714\u00a9 Copyright 2019\u00a0by Socrates Academy\u00a0", "depth": 1},

Regulations: 34 CFR Part 99). This Act was designated to protect the privacy of educational records. Public School Units (PSUs) must annually notify parents and eligible students of their rights under FERPA 34 CFR \u00a7 99.7 which guides the sharing of student directory information and allows them the option to request that the school not disclose this information.Beginning in February, 2020, parents and guardians must make an intentional decision to opt-in or opt-out of the sharing of information. The purpose is to ensure parents and guardians are aware of opportunities available to them and to assist families with the updating of selections each year. When parents initially sign in to PowerSchool Parent Portal, they must choose if they desire to share student contact information per FERPA guidelines. Additionally, parents/guardians of high school students must select if they want to share contact information with colleges, universities and the military.\u00a0Each user of the PowerSchool Parent Portal will be required to answer the applicable questions based on grade level.  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zocVrjWzh5bfQFqLurWxm-2hN-GBn1cL8eEQG88fwyg/edit?usp=sharing\u00a0\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary SchoolSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design Back to top", "depth": 1},
