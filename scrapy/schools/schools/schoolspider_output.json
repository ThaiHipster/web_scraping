It is important to remember, however, that every child\u2019s academic needs are different. And, because every school\u2019s programs and resources vary, parents and students should carefully evaluate a potential school to ensure a good fit between the child\u2019s abilities and the school\u2019s educational philosophy and curriculum.

I am grateful to have the opportunity to lead a school with such determined students, a dedicated staff, and a supportive school community.\u00a0 I feel honored to be part of this school and to support the students and families.\u00a0My official start date at CSS is Monday, August 17th, so our students and I will have the same first day. Rest assured that I am working with the board and Ms. Garrison to make this transition as smooth as possible.\nI have been devoted to educating students for eighteen years, working with students ranging in age from 6th through 12th grade in various roles. I started my education career as a middle school counselor, test coordinator, cheer, and softball coach. During this time I worked to make sure that students were growing academically, personally, and socially. After several years in this role, I became interested in what my students were learning and how they learned. This is when I made the switch to school administration; I wanted to focus on the best ways to help students master the curriculum and be successful in the classroom setting. I moved on to become an Assistant Principal at Cary High School for eight years. Most recently, I served as the Instructional Vice Principal at Davis Middle School in Waldorf, Maryland. I am elated to bring my skills as an educational leader to Charlotte Secondary and to collaborate with you as a partner in education to ensure your child\u2019s success.\nI view education as a life-long learning process for students, parents, and faculty alike and look forward to the greatness that will come from the CSS family. More importantly, I bring a belief that students are at the center of all school-related decisions an should be considered in every choice that we make. \u00a0I am excited to unite my experience, my openness to learn, and my child-centered approach to support our students.\u00a0 Because the relationships between families and the school are vital to the success of our students, I encourage you to become involved in every way possible.\u00a0 I look forward to meeting you soon! \u00a0\nIn closing, please know that my door is always open to you. I heartily welcome your conversation and positive input throughout this year. Let us always keep our students the primary focus of our work. I look forward to celebrating our collective successes during the 2020-2021 school year.\n\nSincerely,\nKeisha C.

Being part of an athletic team at CSS requires hard work and dedication to meet responsibilities to the school, parents and teammates.\n\u200bThere are athletics fees associated with each sport. For the 2018-19 school year, this fee is $100. Additionally, before a student is allowed to play a sport, they must submit a physical form for that academic year. Our athletes are held the highest standards in the classroom, outside the school and during competition.\n\u200bCode of Conduct for Student-Athletes at Charlotte Secondary\n\nThe student-athlete shall keep academics as their number one priority.\nThe student-athlete shall play for the joy of the sport, the success of the team, and to win.\nThe student-athlete shall play hard, but fairly, always mindful of the rules and the spirit/intent of the rules.

This atmosphere provides our students with a variety of experiential learning opportunities. As specified in our charter, we actively recruit students who thrive in a smaller school environment, as well as those who are traditionally under-represented in high school college preparatory programs.\nPrimarily a college and career preparatory school, we gather students from all educational backgrounds and provide them with avenues of enrichment and study that cater to their individual needs. Ultimately our charge is to guide all students in the discovery of their own particular genius, a crucial step in a distinctive life-path.\nOur History\nCharlotte Secondary School is a public charter school that opened in 2007 serving students in middle school grades 6-8. Recognized as a School of Distinction in 2011, the school moved to larger facility and expanded to grades 6-12 in 2014. Charlotte Secondary graduated the first senior class in 2016 with 32 of the 36 graduates enrolling in a 2 or 4-year college.\nOur current senior class exceeds the state average in all 4 college-readiness benchmarks measured by the ACT (English, Math, Reading and Science). Our students continue the tradition of academic excellence set by that first class.\nOur Mission\nWe are a diverse middle and high school community that focuses on college and career preparation and individually tailored learning opportunities to empower all students to reach their full potential.\nOur Vision\nCSS students will be critical thinkers and effective communicators, engaged citizens and life-long learners.\n \n Academics\n Our Leadership\n Our Faculty & Staff\n Board Members\n PTO\n Careers\n Frequently Asked Questions\n McKinney-Vento Act\n Attend Charlotte Secondary School\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

Regulations: 34 CFR Part 99). This Act was designated to protect the privacy of educational records. Public School Units (PSUs) must annually notify parents and eligible students of their rights under FERPA 34 CFR \u00a7 99.7 which guides the sharing of student directory information and allows them the option to request that the school not disclose this information.\nBeginning in February, 2020, parents and guardians must make an intentional decision to opt-in or opt-out of the sharing of information. The purpose is to ensure parents and guardians are aware of opportunities available to them and to assist families with the updating of selections each year. When parents initially sign in to PowerSchool Parent Portal, they must choose if they desire to share student contact information per FERPA guidelines. Additionally, parents/guardians of high school students must select if they want to share contact information with colleges, universities and the military.\n\u00a0\nEach user of the PowerSchool Parent Portal will be required to answer the applicable questions based on grade level.  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zocVrjWzh5bfQFqLurWxm-2hN-GBn1cL8eEQG88fwyg/edit?usp=sharing\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

Some places to start may include:\u00a0\ncommunity food pantries\u00a0local health services and professionals like dental, health, and mental health needs\u00a0local Boys and Girls Clubs, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, United Way, Salvation Army, and other shelter providers;\u00a0faith-based organizations; and\u00a0local businesses or organizations involved in community service. \u00a0\nDispute Resolution\u00a0\nThe following steps and procedures should take place in resolving disputes regarding enrollment, school placement, or services.\u00a0\nComplaint\u00a0\nA complaint is an oral or written and signed statement alleging the violation of a federal or state law, rule, or regulation. The complaint must allege a violation that occurred not more than one (1) year prior to the date that the complaint is received, unless a longer period is reasonable because the violation is considered systemic or ongoing. Parents, teachers, administrators, or other concerned individuals or organizations may file a complaint (\u201cComplainant\u201d). Faculty and staff with knowledge of a complaint must refer the Complainant to the Liaison. The Complainant may submit the complaint in writing to the Liaison, using the attached Complaint Resolution Initiation Form. The Complainant may choose to initiate the complaint orally.\u00a0\nRole of School\u00a0\nImmediately enroll the child in the school preferred by the person(s) bringing the complaint.\u00a0Provide all educational services for which the child is eligible, pending resolution of the dispute.\u00a0\nRole of Liaison\u00a0\nAfter receipt of the complaint, the Liaison must provide a written explanation of the school placement decision and/or provided services to the Complainant and discuss the complaint with the Complainant. The Liaison must provide a written proposed resolution or a plan of action to the Complainant within five (5) days of receipt of the complaint, or within seven (7) business days of notification of dispute (Georgia only).\u00a0If the Liaison does not resolve the dispute, the Complainant may forward it to the school principal.\u00a0The Liaison must provide a written resolution to the parties within five (5) days of the discussion with the principal, or within ten (10) business days of the second dispute (Georgia only). The Complainant has a right to obtain assistance from advocates or attorneys in addressing a complaintThe Liaison will carry out the dispute resolution in an expeditious manner and will provide the. Complainant these written procedures, including the appeal procedures outlined below.\u00a0In the event the school is unable to resolve the complaint, the Complainant may pursue the applicable appeal procedure(s).\u00a0\n\nAppeal Procedures \u2013 North Carolina\n\nIf the dispute is not resolved at the school level, the Complainant may direct the complaint, orally or written, to the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction.\u00a0\nAddress the complaint to the following address:\u00a0\n\nState Coordinator for Homeless Education, National Center for Homeless Education, SERVE Center at UNCG, 5900 Summit Avenue, Ste. 201, Browns Summit, NC 27214.\u00a0\nThe complaint should include:\u00a0\nthe name, address, and telephone number of the person filing the appeal;\u00a0the relationship or connection of the person to the child in question;\u00a0the name and age of the child involved;\u00a0the name of the school and school personnel involved in the complaint;\u00a0the federal requirement alleged to have been violated; a description of the situation that prompted the complaint;\u00a0a description of the attempts that were made to solve the issue;\u00a0supporting documentation; and\u00a0the relief the person is seeking.\u00a0\nThe Liaison will provide the State Homeless Coordinator with any information that the State Homeless Coordinator requests regarding the issues presented in the appeal.\u00a0\nThe State Homeless Coordinator will provide the school and the Complainant the opportunity to respond to any decision made and to provide any additional evidence the Complainant deems relevant.\u00a0\nWithin 10 school days following receipt of the complete appeal, the State Coordinator shall issue a final written decision to the school and the Complainant.\u00a0\nThe Liaison will provide the Complainant an acknowledgement of receipt of the Form Petition and will transmit the Form Petition g the school and receiving transportation services until the Commissioner issues an appeal decision.\u00a0\n\nProfessional Development\u00a0\nLiaison Training\u00a0\nSince ESSA took effect, many states now require Homeless Liaisons to complete training and have a certificate of completion on file. While NHA provides staff training on homeless awareness through OnCourse, the Homeless Liaison at each school should complete the state specific training available and the NCHE Webinars.\u00a0\nStart Professional Development\u00a0\nHomeless Liaisons have a huge role helping so many families and students, but identification of homeless students should not rest on the Liaison alone. All staff at your school may be trained on how to identify homeless students and how to notify the Homeless Liaison of potential homeless students. Federal and state legislation require the Homeless Liaison to conduct staff trainings on these topics annually. This can be accomplished at a staff meeting and documentation such as the agenda or any sign in sheets should be kept as evidence for potential audits. Be sure to take advantage of the readily available presentations located on the NCHE site, or reach out to your State Coordinator for additional resources.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 2},

It is important to remember, however, that every child\u2019s academic needs are different. And, because every school\u2019s programs and resources vary, parents and students should carefully evaluate a potential school to ensure a good fit between the child\u2019s abilities and the school\u2019s educational philosophy and curriculum. CSS strongly encourages parents to attend an Open House and review all prospective family materials.\n\n\n\nWhere do I get an application?\nApplications are available at the school, or you can download using the link below.\nOnce completed, applications can be dropped off or faxed to the school at 704-295-0156. All applications must be signed; we cannot accept an unsigned application, regardless of its delivery method. Applications will be date and time stamped when received. The Lottery will occur on\u00a0March 8, 2019.\u00a0 Applications received after this date will be placed on a waiting list in the order in which they are received.\n Download Student Application\n\n\n\nWhy Charlotte Secondary?\nCharlotte Secondary School knows that children don\u2019t all learn the same way. With individualized instruction, Charlotte Secondary School strives to ensure your child is academically challenged and successful while feeling comfortable in a diverse, safe and bully-free environment. Students actively engage in critical thought and participate in open and respectful discussions. With class sizes at a current 20:1 ratio, your child is guaranteed to receive individual attention and opportunities to academically shine.\nCSS is a great alternative for students who struggle in larger schools.\n\n\n\n\nCurriculum\n\nAre you a college prep school?\nCSS strives to prepare students for \u201cwhat\u2019s next.\u201d\nWe recognize education/schools as the preparation for all Americans to earn a decent livelihood, be a good citizen of the nation and the world, and make a good life for oneself. Our philosophy naturally builds a rigorous college preparatory program \u2013 including 2 and 4-year institutions. Students\u2019 intellectual as well as their ethical and moral growth and their sense of civic responsibility are developed and strengthened. The CSS philosophy supports students\u2019 academic and moral development as closely related skills necessary for developing an individual into an authentic, purposeful learner.\nIn short, we want to prepare our students for life after high school, whether it\u2019s college, community college, technical college or a career.\n\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of a charter school?\n\nImprove student learning\nIncrease learning opportunities for all students with special emphasis on expanded learning experiences for students who are identifies as at risk of academic failure or academically gifted\nEncourage the use of different and innovative teaching methods\nCreate new professional opportunities for teachers\nProvide parents and students with expanded choices\nHold the school accountable for meeting measurable student achievement results\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a charter school?\nCharter schools are public schools in that they:\n\nAre publicly funded through state and local tax revenue;\nDo not charge tuition;\nAre open to all North Carolina residents.\n\nUnlike traditional public schools, though, charter schools are operated by non-profit corporations and governed by the corporation\u2019s Board of Directors rather than the local school board. Also, charter schools are somewhat less regulated than traditional public schools. For example, NC charter schools have more flexibility than traditional public schools with respect to curriculum, teacher salaries and licensure requirements, specifications for school buildings, and purchasing.\nHowever, charter schools are subject to oversight by the State Board of Education and the NC Department of Public Instruction. Charter school facilities must meet all local health and safety requirements and charter school students must take the same end-of-grade and end-of-course tests as other public school students in North Carolina.\nStudents who attend charter schools do so by choice. Charter schools, often referred to as under-funded public schools, receive state and local funding on a per student basis as do traditional public schools. Unlike traditional public schools, charter schools receive no funding for buildings, equipment, campus improvements, technology, transportation, food service, or capital expenditures.\nCSS is a Title 1 school. Please see information below\nClick\u00a0here\u00a0to go to the National Charter School Resource Center website for more information about charter schools.\n\n\n\nWhat are your guiding principles?\nCharlotte Secondary School\u2019s core principles are as follows:\n\nA fundamental purpose of public education is to maintain and advance our democratic society\nA rigorous college preparatory education is the best preparation for civic participation, post-secondary education and the modern workplace\nDiversity is not merely desirable; it is necessary for the accomplishment of our mission\nA good education should be personalized and engage the whole person\nOur teachers will be competent, caring professionals who will grow along with our students\nFamily and community engagement is essential for academic achievement\nA school is always a work in progress; we will pursue continuous improvement through self-assessment and evidence-based practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Documents \n\n\n\nCSS at a Glance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPDF (2.6Mb)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSS at a Glance (ESP)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPDF (2.6Mb)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish Application\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPDF (1Mb)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpanish Application\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPDF (1Mb)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nQuestions?Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Name *FirstLastEmail *Comment or Message *CommentSubmit \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 2},

While some may view chess as a simple game, he believes it is a tool that changes lives and teaches valuable life skills. Mr Brown was also featured in a movie called \u201cA life of a King\u201d starring Cuba Gooding Jr.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: chess, clubs, empowerment, students \n\n\n\n\n\nSocial \n   \n  Recent News \n\nNew CSS Spirit Wear is Here!!\n\n\nA Word from the New Head of School\n\n\nCSS Reopen Plan 2020-21\n\n\n2020-2021 Academic Calendar\n\n\nFAQs For Re-Open 2020-21\n\n\nArchives \nOctober 2020\nAugust 2020\nJuly 2020\nJune 2020\nFebruary 2020\nJanuary 2020\nSeptember 2019\nMarch 2019\nFebruary 2019\n\nSearch our Articles\n\nSearch for:\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 2},

Our school receives funds from the federal government to help students improve in achievement. Title I money provides both extra teachers to work with children and additional funds to purchase materials, supplies, and training opportunities for staff and parents. The best education of students involves partnerships among the home, school, community, and other support agencies. The involvement of parents is important to the school community and to the success of our students. Parent involvement activities will be reviewed annually by parents.\u00a0 The goal is to ensure parents are involved in the planning and implementation of the Title I program at Charlotte Secondary School.\nAnnual Public Meetings\nAnnual Fall and Spring meetings occur to inform parents about parental involvement requirements, school performance, and methods for measuring progress, school facilities and the School-wide Title I program. At the end of the school year, input is solicited from parents to plan, evaluate, and improve the program for next year. Meetings are held throughout the year to train and involve parents in the education of their children. Quarterly meetings are held to enable parents to see our focus for learning, quarterly expectations and data review as well as to involved parents in celebrating the success of our students.\nRegular Meetings\nParents and students are encouraged to participate in Fall in order to gain information about the school\u2019s performance the previous year, and to discuss initiatives for improvement for the current year. Teachers and administrators schedule parent/student conference whenever deemed necessary by the school or when requested by the parents. These conferences are held before, during, or after school hours.\nFlexible Meetings\nRegular and scheduled parent meetings or conferences are held throughout the school year, at various times of the day, to provide continued information, support, and resources for parents. Parents are encouraged to volunteer and attend all school activities.\nInvolving Parents\nParents are encouraged to participate in school activities. Information shall be provided through workshops, family activities, special events, individual parent conferences, educational materials and literature available through school programs and at the school. The school\u2019s Student Assistance Team/ Multi-Tiered Support Team and IEP committees work with parents to assure parent training is adequate to assist their child with achievement strategies.\nParent Comments\nAt each meeting parents will be asked to participate in an evaluation in order that improvements may be made. Parents are also given surveys to complete. Parents and others may continuously provide input on any matter concerning our school. An open door policy prevails here at CSS. Parents are always welcome to share suggestions and comments with teachers, staff, and administration.\nParent Assistance\nState and local expectations are shared with parents at the Parent Information Meeting in the early Fall. EOG/EOC results are shared at the Fall and Spring Title I Annual Meetings. Results are shared in the school\u2019s newsletter and the principal\u2019s letter to our parent community. All grades are sent home interim progress reports, quarterly report cards and special letters, which indicate the child\u2019s progress.\u00a0 In conjunction with these progress reports, meetings are scheduled with parents to discuss specific concerns.\nOpportunities for LEP and SWD Parents\nAll parents are encouraged to attend school functions. Translators will be arranged for parents who speak languages other than English. Whenever possible, meetings are scheduled at the parent\u2019s convenience. Transportation can be arranged, if necessary.\nParents with Limited English Proficiency, Disabilities, Migratory children\nParents of children with limited English proficiency or disabilities are afforded opportunities to participate fully and freely in all education activities at school. Once the need is identified, assistance shall be provided. Whenever possible, information is sent home in native language. Bilingual staff members, parents, ESL instructors and even students are assigned as liaison between home and school. Charlotte Secondary School is handicap accessible.\nEducation of School Personnel\nSchool staff conducts ongoing reviews of student data to ensure timely reporting out of assessment data to the staff. This ensures the staff the tools to identify at-risk students and in turn, share this information with parents. On-going staff development initiatives are continually provided to the staff which focuses on effective communication with parents, establishing a school/family partnership, ways to involve parents, and suggestions for parents to work with children at home.\nInformation\nClassroom teachers and the administration send home notices on a regular basis, such as the Weekly Newsletter and Calendar, and progress reports, etc. Our school web page and the Power School Parent Portal are also tools for communication. Our ELL tutors and Spanish-Speaking staff are used to adapt communications for parents whose primary language is not English.\nCoordinating and Integrating With Other Programs\nCoordination with other programs is evident, starting with the school\u2019s Leadership Team. Emphasis shall be placed on collaboration with Before and After School Tutoring as well as Summer Programs.\n \n Academic Calendar\n Attendance Policy\n School Lunch Program\n After School Program\n Parent & Family Engagement Policy\n Important Forms\n School Supplies List\n Volunteer Application\n Our Faculty & Staff\n Power School\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 2},

Our job will be to make classes engaging and informative while preparing students for their life after they graduate. Your job is to make sure the students are here on time each day.\nBecause we are concerned for your child\u2019s safety and well-being, we ask that you notify the school by phone the morning the student is absent no later than 10:00 AM. Failure to do this will result in the student receiving an absence being recorded as unexcused. Call 704-295-0137.\nExcused Absences limited to:\n\nIllness of the student\nMedical appointments\nDeath of an immediate family member\nCourt appearance\nBona fides religious observances\nApproved educational opportunities\n\nDocumentation of these instances is required through one of these methods: a parent\u2019s note to the attendance office, e-mail notification or fax within 5 days of the student\u2019s return. This documentation is required even if you have previously called the office about an absence, and it must be received within the 5-day period. When a student returns to school following an absence, the student is responsible for making up missed work.\nAs a public school, Charlotte Secondary is required to comply with North Carolina\u2019s Compulsory Attendance law (GS 115C\u2011378.) This law states that guardians are responsible for seeing that their children attend school each day it is in session and may be prosecuted in a criminal action if a student, under the age of 16, has multiple unlawful absences. A notification letter is sent by mail stating that legal action will be taken when a student has reached this absence level.\n \n Academic Calendar\n Attendance Policy\n School Lunch Program\n After School Program\n Parent & Family Engagement Policy\n Important Forms\n School Supplies List\n Volunteer Application\n Our Faculty & Staff\n Power School\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 2},

CSS will conduct learning through the \u201cPlan B\u201d Hybrid plan put forth by the state of North Carolina. This means that face-to-face\u00a0 (F2F) learning and remote (online) learning will be offered throughout the weeks to all students. The instructional day will be from 8:00 AM \u2013 1:00 PM.\u00a0\nFor the first two weeks of school (17 \u2013 28 August), CSS will have two optional in-person (classroom) learning days per week, for both middle and high school. We will operate at half capacity and students will attend according to their last name. The remaining days for those two weeks will be remote (online) learning. The third week of school, CSS will move to one optional face-to-face learning day, for both middle and high school according to according to the following options:\nOption(1) Completely virtual: Students will not attend\u00a0 class in person but will attend virtual class meetings from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM and complete assignments remotely.\u00a0\nOption (2) Hybrid F2F: Students will meet on campus once a week from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM for face to face (F2F) instruction in compliance with social distancing guidelines. All other class meetings for the week will be online.\u00a0\nAttendance\nAttendance will be taken daily, for each class regardless of the option selected. Face to Face instruction is not required however, full participation from students is still expected online, in all classes. To be counted present, high school students are required to participate in online Zoom classes and/or complete a check-in assignment. Middle school students are required to be present and participate in the entire\u00a0 Zoom class meeting everyday for each block.\u00a0\nDaily Instruction\u00a0\nThe instructional day is from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM (in person and online). Students will attend classes by block according to their schedule. Teacher office hours are from 1:30 PM \u2013 3:00 PM. Teachers will be available to meet virtually with parents and students upon request.\u00a0\nGrading\nAll assignments will be graded and used to calculate final grades. At this time, state testing has not been waived for the upcoming school year. CSS will continue to prepare students for NC Check-ins, EOC and EOG assessments.\u00a0\u00a0\nDaily Schedule\nMiddle and high school will operate on a four block schedule of 60 minute classes with a 10 minute transition time between classes. There will be a 30 minute break after the second block.\u00a0\n\n\n\nClass Schedule: 8.00 AM \u2013 1:00 PM\n\n\n1st Block\n8:00 AM\u00a0 \u2013 9:00 AM\n\n\n2nd Block\n9:10 AM\u00a0 \u2013 10:10 AM\n\n\nLunch / Break\n10:20 AM\u00a0 \u2013 10:50 PM\n\n\n3rd Block\n10:50 AM\u00a0 \u2013 11:50 AM\n\n\n4th Block\n12: 00 PM\u00a0 \u2013 1.00 PM\n\n\n\nIn order for instructional time to be most effective and helpful to students, CSS needs to know which\u00a0 students are\u00a0 planning to be in the building for Face to Face learning days after the first two weeks of school.\u00a0 The form below must be completed by AUGUST 10, 2020. After August 10th, the opportunity to attend in-person (classroom) learning will be closed.

It is important to remember, however, that every child\u2019s academic needs are different. And, because every school\u2019s programs and resources vary, parents and students should carefully evaluate a potential school to ensure a good fit between the child\u2019s abilities and the school\u2019s educational philosophy and curriculum. CSS strongly encourages parents to attend an Open House and review all prospective family materials.\nWe encourage prospective parents and students to come and see CSS for themselves.\nTours are currently suspended.\n\u200bFor tours & open house information, please contact Amanda at amanda.talbot@charlottesecondary.org\nDue to School Closures, please download an application and return by email to our registrar, Ms. Tammy Williams:\ntammy.williams@charlottesecondary.org\nOnce completed, applications can be dropped off or faxed to the school at 704-295-0156.

I am grateful to have the opportunity to lead a school with such determined students, a dedicated staff, and a supportive school community.\u00a0 I feel honored to be part of this school and to support the students and families.\u00a0My official start date at CSS is Monday, August 17th, so our students and I will have the same first day. Rest assured that I am working with the board and Ms. Garrison to make this transition as smooth as possible.\nI have been devoted to educating students for eighteen years, working with students ranging in age from 6th through 12th grade in various roles. I started my education career as a middle school counselor, test coordinator, cheer, and softball coach. During this time I worked to make sure that students were growing academically, personally, and socially. After several years in this role, I became interested in what my students were learning and how they learned. This is when I made the switch to school administration; I wanted to focus on the best ways to help students master the curriculum and be successful in the classroom setting. I moved on to become an Assistant Principal at Cary High School for eight years. Most recently, I served as the Instructional Vice Principal at Davis Middle School in Waldorf, Maryland. I am elated to bring my skills as an educational leader to Charlotte Secondary and to collaborate with you as a partner in education to ensure your child\u2019s success.\nI view education as a life-long learning process for students, parents, and faculty alike and look forward to the greatness that will come from the CSS family. More importantly, I bring a belief that students are at the center of all school-related decisions an should be considered in every choice that we make. \u00a0I am excited to unite my experience, my openness to learn, and my child-centered approach to support our students.\u00a0 Because the relationships between families and the school are vital to the success of our students, I encourage you to become involved in every way possible.\u00a0 I look forward to meeting you soon! \u00a0\nIn closing, please know that my door is always open to you. I heartily welcome your conversation and positive input throughout this year. Let us always keep our students the primary focus of our work. I look forward to celebrating our collective successes during the 2020-2021 school year.\n\nSincerely,\nKeisha C.

Being part of an athletic team at CSS requires hard work and dedication to meet responsibilities to the school, parents and teammates.\n\u200bThere are athletics fees associated with each sport. For the 2018-19 school year, this fee is $100. Additionally, before a student is allowed to play a sport, they must submit a physical form for that academic year. Our athletes are held the highest standards in the classroom, outside the school and during competition.\n\u200bCode of Conduct for Student-Athletes at Charlotte Secondary\n\nThe student-athlete shall keep academics as their number one priority.\nThe student-athlete shall play for the joy of the sport, the success of the team, and to win.\nThe student-athlete shall play hard, but fairly, always mindful of the rules and the spirit/intent of the rules. The student-athlete shall treat opponents with respect, shaking hands after all contests.\nThe student-athlete shall respect the judgment of contest officials and accept their decisions.\nThe student-athlete shall exhibit exemplary behavior, thus serving as a positive role model for teammates, opponents, and spectators.\nThe student-athlete shall accept the privileges and responsibilities of representing self, school and community.\u200b\n\nOur goal is to\u00a0 develop the total student-athlete.

This atmosphere provides our students with a variety of experiential learning opportunities. As specified in our charter, we actively recruit students who thrive in a smaller school environment, as well as those who are traditionally under-represented in high school college preparatory programs.\nPrimarily a college and career preparatory school, we gather students from all educational backgrounds and provide them with avenues of enrichment and study that cater to their individual needs. Ultimately our charge is to guide all students in the discovery of their own particular genius, a crucial step in a distinctive life-path.\nOur History\nCharlotte Secondary School is a public charter school that opened in 2007 serving students in middle school grades 6-8. Recognized as a School of Distinction in 2011, the school moved to larger facility and expanded to grades 6-12 in 2014. Charlotte Secondary graduated the first senior class in 2016 with 32 of the 36 graduates enrolling in a 2 or 4-year college.\nOur current senior class exceeds the state average in all 4 college-readiness benchmarks measured by the ACT (English, Math, Reading and Science). Our students continue the tradition of academic excellence set by that first class.\nOur Mission\nWe are a diverse middle and high school community that focuses on college and career preparation and individually tailored learning opportunities to empower all students to reach their full potential.\nOur Vision\nCSS students will be critical thinkers and effective communicators, engaged citizens and life-long learners.\n \n Academics\n Our Leadership\n Our Faculty & Staff\n Board Members\n PTO\n Careers\n Frequently Asked Questions\n McKinney-Vento Act\n Attend Charlotte Secondary School\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

Regulations: 34 CFR Part 99). This Act was designated to protect the privacy of educational records. Public School Units (PSUs) must annually notify parents and eligible students of their rights under FERPA 34 CFR \u00a7 99.7 which guides the sharing of student directory information and allows them the option to request that the school not disclose this information.\nBeginning in February, 2020, parents and guardians must make an intentional decision to opt-in or opt-out of the sharing of information. The purpose is to ensure parents and guardians are aware of opportunities available to them and to assist families with the updating of selections each year. When parents initially sign in to PowerSchool Parent Portal, they must choose if they desire to share student contact information per FERPA guidelines. Additionally, parents/guardians of high school students must select if they want to share contact information with colleges, universities and the military.\n\u00a0\nEach user of the PowerSchool Parent Portal will be required to answer the applicable questions based on grade level.  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zocVrjWzh5bfQFqLurWxm-2hN-GBn1cL8eEQG88fwyg/edit?usp=sharing\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 1},

With CMS deciding last week to go completely remote, we feel at this time that CSS should follow Plan C as well to ensure the safety of our students and staff.\nWe still have quite a few details to work out and will update you as soon as we can. We are planning an Open House of sorts and appreciate your patience with us as we continue to plan for this school year.\nThank you.\nAttendance\nAttendance will be taken daily, for each class.

These relationships will often prove crucial when a family needs access to services and resources to meet basic needs. Some places to start may include:\u00a0\ncommunity food pantries\u00a0local health services and professionals like dental, health, and mental health needs\u00a0local Boys and Girls Clubs, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, United Way, Salvation Army, and other shelter providers;\u00a0faith-based organizations; and\u00a0local businesses or organizations involved in community service. \u00a0\nDispute Resolution\u00a0\nThe following steps and procedures should take place in resolving disputes regarding enrollment, school placement, or services.\u00a0\nComplaint\u00a0\nA complaint is an oral or written and signed statement alleging the violation of a federal or state law, rule, or regulation. The complaint must allege a violation that occurred not more than one (1) year prior to the date that the complaint is received, unless a longer period is reasonable because the violation is considered systemic or ongoing. Parents, teachers, administrators, or other concerned individuals or organizations may file a complaint (\u201cComplainant\u201d). Faculty and staff with knowledge of a complaint must refer the Complainant to the Liaison. The Complainant may submit the complaint in writing to the Liaison, using the attached Complaint Resolution Initiation Form. The Complainant may choose to initiate the complaint orally.\u00a0\nRole of School\u00a0\nImmediately enroll the child in the school preferred by the person(s) bringing the complaint.\u00a0Provide all educational services for which the child is eligible, pending resolution of the dispute.\u00a0\nRole of Liaison\u00a0\nAfter receipt of the complaint, the Liaison must provide a written explanation of the school placement decision and/or provided services to the Complainant and discuss the complaint with the Complainant. The Liaison must provide a written proposed resolution or a plan of action to the Complainant within five (5) days of receipt of the complaint, or within seven (7) business days of notification of dispute (Georgia only).\u00a0If the Liaison does not resolve the dispute, the Complainant may forward it to the school principal.\u00a0The Liaison must provide a written resolution to the parties within five (5) days of the discussion with the principal, or within ten (10) business days of the second dispute (Georgia only). The Complainant has a right to obtain assistance from advocates or attorneys in addressing a complaintThe Liaison will carry out the dispute resolution in an expeditious manner and will provide the. Complainant these written procedures, including the appeal procedures outlined below.\u00a0In the event the school is unable to resolve the complaint, the Complainant may pursue the applicable appeal procedure(s).\u00a0\n\nAppeal Procedures \u2013 North Carolina\n\nIf the dispute is not resolved at the school level, the Complainant may direct the complaint, orally or written, to the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction.\u00a0\nAddress the complaint to the following address:\u00a0\n\nState Coordinator for Homeless Education, National Center for Homeless Education, SERVE Center at UNCG, 5900 Summit Avenue, Ste. 201, Browns Summit, NC 27214.\u00a0\nThe complaint should include:\u00a0\nthe name, address, and telephone number of the person filing the appeal;\u00a0the relationship or connection of the person to the child in question;\u00a0the name and age of the child involved;\u00a0the name of the school and school personnel involved in the complaint;\u00a0the federal requirement alleged to have been violated; a description of the situation that prompted the complaint;\u00a0a description of the attempts that were made to solve the issue;\u00a0supporting documentation; and\u00a0the relief the person is seeking.\u00a0\nThe Liaison will provide the State Homeless Coordinator with any information that the State Homeless Coordinator requests regarding the issues presented in the appeal.\u00a0\nThe State Homeless Coordinator will provide the school and the Complainant the opportunity to respond to any decision made and to provide any additional evidence the Complainant deems relevant.\u00a0\nWithin 10 school days following receipt of the complete appeal, the State Coordinator shall issue a final written decision to the school and the Complainant.\u00a0\nThe Liaison will provide the Complainant an acknowledgement of receipt of the Form Petition and will transmit the Form Petition g the school and receiving transportation services until the Commissioner issues an appeal decision.\u00a0\n\nProfessional Development\u00a0\nLiaison Training\u00a0\nSince ESSA took effect, many states now require Homeless Liaisons to complete training and have a certificate of completion on file. While NHA provides staff training on homeless awareness through OnCourse, the Homeless Liaison at each school should complete the state specific training available and the NCHE Webinars.\u00a0\nStart Professional Development\u00a0\nHomeless Liaisons have a huge role helping so many families and students, but identification of homeless students should not rest on the Liaison alone. All staff at your school may be trained on how to identify homeless students and how to notify the Homeless Liaison of potential homeless students. Federal and state legislation require the Homeless Liaison to conduct staff trainings on these topics annually. This can be accomplished at a staff meeting and documentation such as the agenda or any sign in sheets should be kept as evidence for potential audits. Be sure to take advantage of the readily available presentations located on the NCHE site, or reach out to your State Coordinator for additional resources.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 2},

It is important to remember, however, that every child\u2019s academic needs are different. And, because every school\u2019s programs and resources vary, parents and students should carefully evaluate a potential school to ensure a good fit between the child\u2019s abilities and the school\u2019s educational philosophy and curriculum. CSS strongly encourages parents to attend an Open House and review all prospective family materials.\n\n\n\nWhere do I get an application?\nApplications are available at the school, or you can download using the link below.\nOnce completed, applications can be dropped off or faxed to the school at 704-295-0156. All applications must be signed; we cannot accept an unsigned application, regardless of its delivery method. Applications will be date and time stamped when received. The Lottery will occur on\u00a0March 8, 2019.\u00a0 Applications received after this date will be placed on a waiting list in the order in which they are received.\n Download Student Application\n\n\n\nWhy Charlotte Secondary?\nCharlotte Secondary School knows that children don\u2019t all learn the same way. With individualized instruction, Charlotte Secondary School strives to ensure your child is academically challenged and successful while feeling comfortable in a diverse, safe and bully-free environment. Students actively engage in critical thought and participate in open and respectful discussions. With class sizes at a current 20:1 ratio, your child is guaranteed to receive individual attention and opportunities to academically shine.\nCSS is a great alternative for students who struggle in larger schools.\n\n\n\n\nCurriculum\n\nAre you a college prep school?\nCSS strives to prepare students for \u201cwhat\u2019s next.\u201d\nWe recognize education/schools as the preparation for all Americans to earn a decent livelihood, be a good citizen of the nation and the world, and make a good life for oneself. Our philosophy naturally builds a rigorous college preparatory program \u2013 including 2 and 4-year institutions. Students\u2019 intellectual as well as their ethical and moral growth and their sense of civic responsibility are developed and strengthened. The CSS philosophy supports students\u2019 academic and moral development as closely related skills necessary for developing an individual into an authentic, purposeful learner.\nIn short, we want to prepare our students for life after high school, whether it\u2019s college, community college, technical college or a career.\n\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of a charter school?\n\nImprove student learning\nIncrease learning opportunities for all students with special emphasis on expanded learning experiences for students who are identifies as at risk of academic failure or academically gifted\nEncourage the use of different and innovative teaching methods\nCreate new professional opportunities for teachers\nProvide parents and students with expanded choices\nHold the school accountable for meeting measurable student achievement results\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a charter school?\nCharter schools are public schools in that they:\n\nAre publicly funded through state and local tax revenue;\nDo not charge tuition;\nAre open to all North Carolina residents.\n\nUnlike traditional public schools, though, charter schools are operated by non-profit corporations and governed by the corporation\u2019s Board of Directors rather than the local school board. Also, charter schools are somewhat less regulated than traditional public schools. For example, NC charter schools have more flexibility than traditional public schools with respect to curriculum, teacher salaries and licensure requirements, specifications for school buildings, and purchasing.\nHowever, charter schools are subject to oversight by the State Board of Education and the NC Department of Public Instruction. Charter school facilities must meet all local health and safety requirements and charter school students must take the same end-of-grade and end-of-course tests as other public school students in North Carolina.\nStudents who attend charter schools do so by choice. Charter schools, often referred to as under-funded public schools, receive state and local funding on a per student basis as do traditional public schools. Unlike traditional public schools, charter schools receive no funding for buildings, equipment, campus improvements, technology, transportation, food service, or capital expenditures.\nCSS is a Title 1 school. Please see information below\nClick\u00a0here\u00a0to go to the National Charter School Resource Center website for more information about charter schools.\n\n\n\nWhat are your guiding principles?\nCharlotte Secondary School\u2019s core principles are as follows:\n\nA fundamental purpose of public education is to maintain and advance our democratic society\nA rigorous college preparatory education is the best preparation for civic participation, post-secondary education and the modern workplace\nDiversity is not merely desirable; it is necessary for the accomplishment of our mission\nA good education should be personalized and engage the whole person\nOur teachers will be competent, caring professionals who will grow along with our students\nFamily and community engagement is essential for academic achievement\nA school is always a work in progress; we will pursue continuous improvement through self-assessment and evidence-based practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Documents \n\n\n\nCSS at a Glance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPDF (2.6Mb)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSS at a Glance (ESP)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPDF (2.6Mb)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish Application\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPDF (1Mb)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpanish Application\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPDF (1Mb)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nQuestions?Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Name *FirstLastEmail *Comment or Message *CommentSubmit \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 2},

Our school receives funds from the federal government to help students improve in achievement. Title I money provides both extra teachers to work with children and additional funds to purchase materials, supplies, and training opportunities for staff and parents. The best education of students involves partnerships among the home, school, community, and other support agencies. The involvement of parents is important to the school community and to the success of our students. Parent involvement activities will be reviewed annually by parents.\u00a0 The goal is to ensure parents are involved in the planning and implementation of the Title I program at Charlotte Secondary School.\nAnnual Public Meetings\nAnnual Fall and Spring meetings occur to inform parents about parental involvement requirements, school performance, and methods for measuring progress, school facilities and the School-wide Title I program. At the end of the school year, input is solicited from parents to plan, evaluate, and improve the program for next year. Meetings are held throughout the year to train and involve parents in the education of their children. Quarterly meetings are held to enable parents to see our focus for learning, quarterly expectations and data review as well as to involved parents in celebrating the success of our students.\nRegular Meetings\nParents and students are encouraged to participate in Fall in order to gain information about the school\u2019s performance the previous year, and to discuss initiatives for improvement for the current year. Teachers and administrators schedule parent/student conference whenever deemed necessary by the school or when requested by the parents. These conferences are held before, during, or after school hours.\nFlexible Meetings\nRegular and scheduled parent meetings or conferences are held throughout the school year, at various times of the day, to provide continued information, support, and resources for parents. Parents are encouraged to volunteer and attend all school activities.\nInvolving Parents\nParents are encouraged to participate in school activities. Information shall be provided through workshops, family activities, special events, individual parent conferences, educational materials and literature available through school programs and at the school. The school\u2019s Student Assistance Team/ Multi-Tiered Support Team and IEP committees work with parents to assure parent training is adequate to assist their child with achievement strategies.\nParent Comments\nAt each meeting parents will be asked to participate in an evaluation in order that improvements may be made. Parents are also given surveys to complete. Parents and others may continuously provide input on any matter concerning our school. An open door policy prevails here at CSS. Parents are always welcome to share suggestions and comments with teachers, staff, and administration.\nParent Assistance\nState and local expectations are shared with parents at the Parent Information Meeting in the early Fall. EOG/EOC results are shared at the Fall and Spring Title I Annual Meetings. Results are shared in the school\u2019s newsletter and the principal\u2019s letter to our parent community. All grades are sent home interim progress reports, quarterly report cards and special letters, which indicate the child\u2019s progress.\u00a0 In conjunction with these progress reports, meetings are scheduled with parents to discuss specific concerns.\nOpportunities for LEP and SWD Parents\nAll parents are encouraged to attend school functions. Translators will be arranged for parents who speak languages other than English. Whenever possible, meetings are scheduled at the parent\u2019s convenience. Transportation can be arranged, if necessary.\nParents with Limited English Proficiency, Disabilities, Migratory children\nParents of children with limited English proficiency or disabilities are afforded opportunities to participate fully and freely in all education activities at school. Once the need is identified, assistance shall be provided. Whenever possible, information is sent home in native language. Bilingual staff members, parents, ESL instructors and even students are assigned as liaison between home and school. Charlotte Secondary School is handicap accessible.\nEducation of School Personnel\nSchool staff conducts ongoing reviews of student data to ensure timely reporting out of assessment data to the staff. This ensures the staff the tools to identify at-risk students and in turn, share this information with parents. On-going staff development initiatives are continually provided to the staff which focuses on effective communication with parents, establishing a school/family partnership, ways to involve parents, and suggestions for parents to work with children at home.\nInformation\nClassroom teachers and the administration send home notices on a regular basis, such as the Weekly Newsletter and Calendar, and progress reports, etc. Our school web page and the Power School Parent Portal are also tools for communication. Our ELL tutors and Spanish-Speaking staff are used to adapt communications for parents whose primary language is not English.\nCoordinating and Integrating With Other Programs\nCoordination with other programs is evident, starting with the school\u2019s Leadership Team. Emphasis shall be placed on collaboration with Before and After School Tutoring as well as Summer Programs.\n \n Academic Calendar\n Attendance Policy\n School Lunch Program\n After School Program\n Parent & Family Engagement Policy\n Important Forms\n School Supplies List\n Volunteer Application\n Our Faculty & Staff\n Power School\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 2},

Our job will be to make classes engaging and informative while preparing students for their life after they graduate. Your job is to make sure the students are here on time each day.\nBecause we are concerned for your child\u2019s safety and well-being, we ask that you notify the school by phone the morning the student is absent no later than 10:00 AM. Failure to do this will result in the student receiving an absence being recorded as unexcused. Call 704-295-0137.\nExcused Absences limited to:\n\nIllness of the student\nMedical appointments\nDeath of an immediate family member\nCourt appearance\nBona fides religious observances\nApproved educational opportunities\n\nDocumentation of these instances is required through one of these methods: a parent\u2019s note to the attendance office, e-mail notification or fax within 5 days of the student\u2019s return. This documentation is required even if you have previously called the office about an absence, and it must be received within the 5-day period. When a student returns to school following an absence, the student is responsible for making up missed work.\nAs a public school, Charlotte Secondary is required to comply with North Carolina\u2019s Compulsory Attendance law (GS 115C\u2011378.) This law states that guardians are responsible for seeing that their children attend school each day it is in session and may be prosecuted in a criminal action if a student, under the age of 16, has multiple unlawful absences. A notification letter is sent by mail stating that legal action will be taken when a student has reached this absence level.\n \n Academic Calendar\n Attendance Policy\n School Lunch Program\n After School Program\n Parent & Family Engagement Policy\n Important Forms\n School Supplies List\n Volunteer Application\n Our Faculty & Staff\n Power School\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2019 Charlotte Secondary School\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSite designed & maintained by Red Cape Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "depth": 2},

CSS will conduct learning through the \u201cPlan B\u201d Hybrid plan put forth by the state of North Carolina. This means that face-to-face\u00a0 (F2F) learning and remote (online) learning will be offered throughout the weeks to all students. The instructional day will be from 8:00 AM \u2013 1:00 PM.\u00a0\nFor the first two weeks of school (17 \u2013 28 August), CSS will have two optional in-person (classroom) learning days per week, for both middle and high school. We will operate at half capacity and students will attend according to their last name. The remaining days for those two weeks will be remote (online) learning. The third week of school, CSS will move to one optional face-to-face learning day, for both middle and high school according to according to the following options:\nOption(1) Completely virtual: Students will not attend\u00a0 class in person but will attend virtual class meetings from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM and complete assignments remotely.\u00a0\nOption (2) Hybrid F2F: Students will meet on campus once a week from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM for face to face (F2F) instruction in compliance with social distancing guidelines. All other class meetings for the week will be online.\u00a0\nAttendance\nAttendance will be taken daily, for each class regardless of the option selected. Face to Face instruction is not required however, full participation from students is still expected online, in all classes. To be counted present, high school students are required to participate in online Zoom classes and/or complete a check-in assignment. Middle school students are required to be present and participate in the entire\u00a0 Zoom class meeting everyday for each block.\u00a0\nDaily Instruction\u00a0\nThe instructional day is from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM (in person and online). Students will attend classes by block according to their schedule. Teacher office hours are from 1:30 PM \u2013 3:00 PM. Teachers will be available to meet virtually with parents and students upon request.\u00a0\nGrading\nAll assignments will be graded and used to calculate final grades. At this time, state testing has not been waived for the upcoming school year. CSS will continue to prepare students for NC Check-ins, EOC and EOG assessments.\u00a0\u00a0\nDaily Schedule\nMiddle and high school will operate on a four block schedule of 60 minute classes with a 10 minute transition time between classes.
