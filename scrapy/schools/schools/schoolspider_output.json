Particular emphasis is placed on developing proficiency in reading, writing, and mathematics both in English and Greek through the use of the Socratic Method. Our Core Values Our vibrant school community embodies the following values: Filotimo (Greek: ): lmost impossible to translate sufficiently, as it describes a complex array of virtues that encompass honor, dignity and pride; to always act with righteousness, integrity, and honor. Arete (Greek: ): Excellence of any kind and moral virtue. Fulfillment of purpose or function: the act of living up to one's full potential. Philoxenia (Greek: ): eagerness to show hospitality Ethos (Greek: ): Ethical Behavior Personal Responsibility: Each person is accountable for their actions and the welfare of their community. Empathy and Kindness: Engaging in cognitive, emotional, and compassionate understanding of others and responding with kindness. Respect of Diversity, Equity, and Justice Moral Courage: Doing what is right and leading by example Strive for Excellence (Greek: ): Setting goals and always striving to do ones best and seeking continuous improvement The Socrates Approach The Academys multilingual, multicultural curriculum follows both the North Carolina Essential Standards and Common Core (language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, physical education, art, and music) and the National Greek Curriculum Standards (language arts, mathematics, and Greek culture). Instruction relies on the Socratic Method to foster critical analytical thinking. The program is characterized by high academic quality with a special emphasis in mathematics, reading, writing, character development, multiculturalism, and early learning of a second and third language. What is the Socratic Method? Definition:the use of questions as employed by Socrates to develop a latent idea, as in the mind of a pupil, or to elicit admissions, as from an opponent,tending to establish a proposition. The Socratic Method is the oldest, and still the most powerful, teaching tactic for fostering critical thinking. It is also know as inquiry-based teaching. In Socratic teaching we focus on giving students questions, not answers. We model an inquiring, probing mind by continually probing into the subject with questions. Questions are used to arouse curiosity and at the same time serve as a logical, incremental, step-wise guide that enables students to figure out about a complex topic or issue with their own thinking and insights. The Socratic method is an integral part of instruction at Socrates Academy. This method of thought and analysis has been in use since the time of the ancient Greeks and has been recognized as not only an effective teaching tool, but also an engaging way for students to take an active role in their own education.

We are so grateful that Socrates Academy is a K-8 school, and that the academic and social transitions from 5th to 6th grade are so seamless here. Elementary classes prepare Socrates students for the academic variety and rigor of the middle school curriculum, and upon graduating to middle school, students have a balanced mix of responsibilities and freedoms that result in opportunities for students to establish their own independence.

There are a lot of different opinions on how to return to learning this month. About the only thing we can all agree on is that no one is going to be happy with how this school year is starting.We get it. Distance learning doesnt replace being in a classroom and is a struggle for parents, students, and teachers. At the same time, many educators and parents share concerns about the potential for the spread of COVID-19 at schools.The tough decisions on how communities are returning to schools are being made by your local school leaders under the requirements set forth by Governor Cooper and his team. Every school faces unique challenges that reflect the uniqueness of each community, so different decisions will be made for different communities. Currently, two out of three of North Carolinas students will start this school year with distance learning.At your NC Department of Public Instruction, we have been supporting local schools and communities by providing multiple strategies on how schools can meet the COVID-19 requirements for in-person learning. We have worked closely with local districts to strengthen distance learning so that it is improved from what students, parents, and teachers faced at the end of last school year. It still will not be perfect, but it will be better and specifically should have more live interactions with teachers, even if over video chats. Please click here to visit our resource page for parents and teachers.Please join us as we work to help encourage each other and our students. We can all agree that no one is happy that COVID-19 has created obstacles unlike any we have ever faced. We dont have to agree on everything after that, but lets work together, with grace and encouragement, to overcome the challenges ahead.Sincerely,Mark Johnson NC Superintendent of Public Instruction @MarkRJohnsonNCContact UsHOME CAREERS FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.

I continue to be amazed at the dedication of our staff and hard work of our scholars. From Socratic Seminars in 8th grade to Number Detectives in 1st grade, our teachers are engaging scholars in creative ways each day. We miss our scholars and cannot wait until the day they return to the building. But, in the meantime, we are committed to delivering excellence virtually.It is important to note that our teachers are reflecting each day on instruction and scholar needs. Teachers meet multiple times a week to collaboratively plan and analyze student progress. As we progress with remote learning, we will continue to evaluate our strengths and opportunities for improvement. One area we continue to evaluate is our K-4 Special Area classes. Feedback received in the summer was that many parents were concerned about screen time and lengthy school days. Special area classes were designated for one day a week in grades K-4 to reduce screen time and prevent a longer day. Parents have the option to structure the specials day in whatever manner meets the needs of your scholar. Scholars can complete the specials just as scheduled on their assigned day or alternatively, they can complete their specials throughout the week. Going forward, specials will be posted on the grade level weekly planner. Scholars will have until Friday to complete their special area assignments. Some have asked why we continue with special area classes during remote learning. Special area classes are not filler classes. Instead, each class serves a purpose to help our scholars meet standards in the areas of information and technology, physical education, literacy, and the arts. For many scholars, they look forward to these classes and it provides a creative outlet for them to excel. Soon the special area team will begin hosting live sessions for scholars to join and complete activities. Look for more information to come about this exciting event. Contact the special area teacher if you have any questions or concerns regarding the schedule or expectations:Myles Pearl, PE - mpearl@socratesacademy.usAlex Keilen, Technology - akeilen@socratesacademy.usSue Mabon, Library - smabon@socratesacademy.usCarolyn Decker, Music - cdecker@socratesacademy.usKaren Peyton, Art - kpeyton@socratesacademy.us *Special area teachers can also be messaged through Class Dojo messenger.Collaboration between teacher and parent is vital to the success of our scholars. I encourage you to reach out to your scholars teacher(s) if you have any questions or concerns. If they cant help you, they will connect you with the person who can help you. Please make sure you are connected to all of our information platforms - Class Dojo, our website, our Facebook page, and through our weekly Socrates Connection newsletter.

To do so, we aim toupdate 240 student laptopsthis year to newer models. 2) Teaching Success Ongoing professional development ensures our teachers are engaged and equipped with up-to-date knowledge and practices in the classroom. We invest in our staff, significantly beyond what is required by the state of North Carolina, to create a dynamic, 21st century learning environment for our scholars. Additionally, beginning teachers at Socrates Academy receive professional support and guidance from an assigned mentor. These veteran teachers invest tremendous time and energy as mentors and play a vital role in the development and retention of talented new teachers. We would like toprovide these mentors with an additional stipendto reflect the lasting value they pass on to the school and our scholars. 3) Hitting the Books A strong foundation in reading is a key building block towards long-term academic success. We plan to purchase a diverse range ofreading materials to be used every day in grades K-3, the foundational years in which student learn how to read. A classroom library that is well-stocked with a wide selection of diverse trade books will enhance their exposure to all genres and make more proficient readers.LEARN MOREContact UsHOME CAREERS FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.

Please keep heat low to prevent false temperature readings. Pull to a spot marked by a cone and wait until a staff member opens the door. Do not drop off on your own. You will be asked three questions by a staff member: Has your child been a close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes without a mask) in the last 14 days with someone diagnosed with Covid 19 or has the health department told them to quarantine? Does your child have any of these symptoms: fever, chills, shortness of breath, cough, loss of taste/smell? Does your child have Covid 19? If you answer 'Yes' to any of the questions, your student and all other family members cannot come to school. If you answer 'No', the staff member will check your child's temperature. If it is 100.4 or higher, your child and all other family members cannot come to school. If it is close to 100.4 we may ask you to pull to the side parking lot, wait a few minutes, and then we will re-check it.

All grades use this space for lunches, performances, after school events and dances.1/17Frequently Asked Questions How does the lottery work? The date, time and place of the lottery will be communicated to all applicants. The lottery will be open to the public. Lotteries will be held for any grade in which the number of applications exceeds the number of openings. Names will be randomly drawn and applicants admitted based on the order they are selected. The lottery will continue until all names are drawn. Applicants who do not get admitted during the lottery process will be placed on a Waiting List in the order their names were drawn. Applications received after the end of the Open Enrollment Period will be added to the waiting lists in the order they are received. For grade levels that still have openings after the lottery, registrants will be admitted on a \"first come, first served\" basis. What is Siblings Preference? Socrates Academy supports families with multiple children attending the school together. Siblings of current students will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a Sibling Priority Waiting List. Siblings are defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time. When an opening becomes available at a grade level, students will be admitted first from the Sibling Priority Waiting List and then from the regular Waiting List if there are no siblings waiting at that grade level. Children of newly hired staff members will be automatically admitted ahead of students on either waiting list. PLEASE NOTE: A lottery admitted student must attend Socrates Academy in order for siblings drawn under the sibling rule to be able to attend. If registrants who are selected for admission decide NOT to enroll at Socrates Academy, the parents of the next child on the Waiting List for that grade will be notified immediately. If I turn my application in early is it prioritized in the lottery? No, all applications are entered into the lottery at the same time. Do I need to be present at the lottery in order for my child to get in? No. You do not need to be present at the lottery drawing in order for your child to gain placement. Will you give me my childs number ahead of time? No. The assigned lottery numbers are for the lottery process only but will be provided to applicants who attend the lottery. Do siblings automatically get in? Siblings of current students are given priority in open spaces when there are enough open spaces for siblings. If there are more siblings of current students than open spaces, for example in upper grades, siblings are put into a lottery for placement. Once open spots are filled, all additional names are put onto a wait list. If a space opens up during the school year and I am on the waiting list, how will I be notified? We notify applicants who are pulled from the wait list by phone or email. Can I register at two schools while I try to make my decision? No. The State of North Carolina will not allow you to register at two schools at the same time. If you are registered at Socrates Academy, you will need to officially withdraw before you will be able to register at your new school. How will I be notified if my child is accepted into the school? Your acceptance packet or wait list number will be sent by email. Will results be posted online? No. We do not post lottery results online for privacy reasons. How does the lottery work if you have twins? Twins are entered into the lottery one time because they are treated as one entry. When twins are drawn in the lottery they both will be able to take open positions at the school. If Im on the wait list when can I expect to hear if my child got in? You will be notified by phone or email if a position opens for your child. How are the accepted lottery applicants determined? The lottery results are determined by a computerized program that randomly selects applicants. My child wasnt selected in this years lottery, will I need to fill out another application next year if I want to apply? Yes. Each time you wish for your childs name to be entered in the lottery, you will need to fill out a current application. Can I submit my childs application even if he does not meet the state age requirement? No. We will only accept students that meet the state age requirement for the lottery. Your child must be five years old on or before August 31st of the year they are applying for. I applied for two/three of my children for the same program, will all students receive placement? Only students that are accepted through the lottery process or from the wait list will receive placement. What if I dont have all of my paperwork to submit with the application? Student applications will need to be complete with all required paperwork in order to be entered into the lottery. What if I miss the due date for the application but still want to apply? Any applications received after the due date will not be entered into the lottery but will go to the bottom of the wait list in the order received. Can I call the school to get my lottery results? We ask that you check your email before calling the school. Results will not be given over the phone Can I have someone else pick up my lottery results? Lottery results will only be provided to a parent or guardian. Contact UsHOME CAREERS FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.

Special events that fall on weekends, committees that meet one evening a month, and work that can be completed at home are just a few examples. To learn more about ways to volunteer, contact jsoucey@socratesacademy.us What happens if I don't volunteer? Our volunteer commitment is listed in our charter, which means we can be turned down for Charter Renewal or lose the Charter that we have if we do not meet our volunteer requirements as a school. Why do I have to volunteer? North Carolina charter schools receive state and federal funding for each student. However, state educational funding across North Carolina has declined year over year since 2009, and total funding for charters is still significantly less than for public schools. Charter schools do not receive a share of the North Carolina Lottery money earmarked for education. Charter schools do not receive state or federal funding for purchase or maintenance of facilities. In order for Socrates Academy to continue to provide an exceptional educational experience for all of our scholars, we must seek creative ways to bridge that gap. Volunteering makes a huge difference in this area, while increasing family engagement in the school and strengthening the Socrates community. This is why the volunteer requirement is included in the enrollment paperwork for all Socrates scholars. How many hours do I have to complete? 36 Volunteer Hours are required from each family that attends Socrates Academy. What constitutes a Socrates Academy volunteer hour? A volunteer hour is an hour spent at the request of the school (Administration, teachers, BOD, Foundation, PFI) engaged in an activity in support of the school mission. Examples include: Participating in Committee work Attending Town Hall meetings or Board Meetings Planning, setting up and/or breaking down for meetings Work for school at home (worksheet cut outs, scholastic flyers, etc) Working a special event Fulfilling duties for committees What does notconstitute a Socrates Academy volunteer hour? Eating lunch with your scholar Attending parent/teacher conferences Can other family members, (Grandparents, Siblings, Aunt or Uncles) volunteer? We love to see the whole family involved with the school. Additional family members are welcome to volunteer their time and talents with us. We are appreciative of each and every hour they volunteer. Can I donate my hours? Yes. If you have additional hours, please log them either in a friends name, or in your own name. At the end of the year all of the hours are totaled and averaged together. How will my hours be tracked? Use the volunteer log on the website to track your hours. You are now unable to search your hours online. We are looking at solutions, but for now, please make sure your email address is correct when you log your hours, because totals will be sent there. Please use the same email address each time you fill out the volunteer log. Contact UsHOME CAREERS FORMS & PAYMENTS3909 Weddington Rd.

An alternative to bringing lunch is to order from our Hot Lunch Menu. Hot Lunch is prepared off site and brought in to the scholars and must be ordered 2-4 weeks in advance. Learn more about Hot Lunch HERE. Students walk from their classroom to lunch each day with their class and eat in the cafeteria with their teacher. Students are not permitted to share food. Students are not permitted to bring soda in their lunches. Students may not be pulled from class during instruction to have lunch with a sibling unless their lunch schedule is the same. The Discipline Policy/Code of Conduct applies to all student actions during lunch Socrates Academy provides a table in the cafeteria that is to be kept free of the type of allergen(s) that impact the identified student(s). While this table is available to the identified student(s), they are not be required to eat only at this table. Snacks may be purchased from the Hot Lunch counter with cash only. Items for purchase include, but are not limited to, chips, drinks, muffins and fruit. FORGOTTEN LUNCHES Forgotten lunches should be brought to the Middle School building and placed on the stage. Students are taught to check the stage for their lunch before calling home. If a student has forgotten their lunch and a parent is unable to be reached, they are able to buy lunch with credit from the Hot Lunch counter. The student will need to bring cash money for payment the next day. VISITING DURING LUNCH Any family members visiting during lunch, must sign in with a license at either office. Please meet your child in the cafeteria, not in the classroom. We ask that parents do not join younger students for lunch during the first two weeks of school, as it can be upsetting to the student when the family member leaves after lunch. If a parent wishes to send in a treat for their childs birthday, they may coordinate with the homeroom teacher about a time for the treat to be brought to school. It is the policy of Socrates Academy that all food provided for consumption of our scholars must be commercially prepared, with the ingredient label visible. Our allergy management policy can be found HERE Volunteers are needed to work behind the Hot Lunch counter and also in the main cafeteria area. If you would like to volunteer during lunches, please check the volunteer section at the bottom of the Socrates Connection for the sign up.HOT LUNCH In order for the process to operate efficiently and enable the school to continue the hot lunch program, the following guidelines must be observed.

OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreSearchSocrates AcademyJan 31, 20192 min readWe Need Your Help! Dear Socrates Academy Families and Friends, Thank you for your ongoing support to the Socrates Academy Annual Fund! Your Annual Fund Gift will have a positive and meaningful impact on the lives of our Socrates Scholars. Will you please join the many parents, staff, and board members who have already contributed to this years campaign? Your support will enhance and expand educational opportunities for scholars at our National Blue Ribbon School, one of the top 1% schools in the United States! Your donation can make our great school even better. Here are the three top areas we hope to improve in 2018-2019 using your Annual Fund donations: 1) Technology in the classroom - We strive to educate our scholars in all grades using the latest technology. To do so, we aim to update 240 student laptops this year to newer models. 2) Teaching Success Ongoing professional development ensures our teachers are engaged and equipped with up-to-date knowledge and practices in the classroom. We invest in our staff, significantly beyond what is required by the state of North Carolina, to create a dynamic, 21st century learning environment for our scholars. Additionally, beginning teachers at Socrates Academy receive professional support and guidance from an assigned mentor. These veteran teachers invest tremendous time and energy as mentors and play a vital role in the development and retention of talented new teachers. We would like to provide these mentors with an additional stipend to reflect the lasting value they pass on to the school and our scholars. 3) Hitting the Books A strong foundation in reading is a key building block towards long-term academic success. We plan to purchase a diverse range of reading materials to be used every day in grades K-3, the foundational years in which student learn how to read. A classroom library that is well-stocked with a wide selection of diverse trade books will enhance their exposure to all genres and make more proficient readers. Today, charter schools like Socrates Academy receive considerable less per-pupil revenue than district-run traditional public schools. In order to overcome this funding gap and continue to offer award-winning educational and extracurricular programs, Socrates Academy must maintain a supplemental stream of revenue. Were reaching out to ask for your participation and support again this year. Your donation will be used to support our 2018-2019 goals and will have a direct impact on our schools success.

There are NO left turns out of the school parking lots onto Weddington Road between the hours of 7:45 am-8:15 am. ALL scholars must come through the carpool line. Secondary school parents may drop off scholars from 7:45am-8:00am. Elementary scholars may be dropped off in either parking lot. If you are coming from the McKee Road, we strongly encourage you to turn left into the upper parking lot (entrance between the painted rocks) in order to prevent back-ups on Weddington Road. If you are coming from Antioch Church Road, we encourage you to turn right into the lower parking lot (entrance near the Couchell Building). Do not stop in front of a building. Proceed to the front of the line when dropping off your scholars. There is NO passing in carpool line. Tardy Scholars Elementary scholars who arrive in the lot after8:10amare considered tardy. Secondary School scholars who arrive after8:00am,are considered tardy. Parents must sign their children in at the front office (Elementary scholars get signed in at the Couchell Building, and Secondary School scholars get signed in at the Secondary School building) to get a tardy slip. Dismissal Procedures Cars may not line up in either parking lot before 3:00 pm. Carpool Signs Carpool signs should be placed in the dashboard window and kept in the window until you leave the parking lot. If a carpool sign is not present, the car will be pulled to the side, driver ID checked, and driver verified as an authorized driver on the carpool form with the office staff. Please keep your carpool sign from year to year, unless there is a change that needs to be made to the sign. It is a good idea to put your sign in a plastic sheet protector or laminate it. Afternoon Carpool (6-8 Students) All cars will be directed to exit between the two parking islands instead of at the furthest island. If your student does not come to carpool after the first call, you will be asked to park in the new Second Call Parking Area. Begins at 3:30 pm. Grades 6-8 are dismissed from the upper parking lot. Parents will enter through the entrance between the painted rocks and will exit via Simfield Church Road. Afternoon Carpool (K-5 Students) Begins at 3:30pm. Grades 4 and 5 are dismissed from the upper parking lot (with and without siblings). Grades K-3 are dismissed from the lower lot (only if they do not have 4th-8th gradesiblings). All students will go to the classroom of their older sibling for carpool. This includes K-3 students that have siblings in Middle School. K-3 students with Middle School siblings, will not come into the Middle School, but will be supervised in the 4th and 5th Grade building. They will be called at the same time that their Middle School Sibling is called. The siblings will meet at the carpool zone. There are NO left turns out of the school parking lots between the hours of 3:15pm-4:15pm. Cars must be in the parking lot before 3:55pm. If you arrive after carpool has ended, your student will be sent to Afterschool. There is a $1.00 per minute charge up to a maximum of $20.00 for this service. General Guidelines Walkers Scholars who walk must live within one mile of the school, and parents must complete a form to be approved by the administration. If a parent is driving a car to pick up a walker, then he or she must go through the carpool line. Elementary walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet in front of the Elementary Building. Middle School walkers being picked up by a walking parent will meet at the roundabout near the Secondary School. Church Next Door We are NOT using the church next door for parking or carpool. Parents who park at the church do so at their own risk and may be towed. Parents are not to wait in the church parking lot until it is 3:00pm, when you are permitted to enter our lot for elementary dismissal. Cell Phones Cell phone use is prohibited to ensure that everyone is focused on keeping our scholars safe. Thank you for helping us maintain safety for everyone!

Isn't it a public school? Socrates Academy is indeed a public school, but it is also a charter school. Each year, North Carolina charter schools receive a fixed, per-pupil stipend from state and local government sources, which doesn't include funding for a building, bus services or salary increases for teachers with advanced degrees. Socrates Academy must finance facilities expenditures out of general operating revenues, privately raised funds, or partnerships with other organizations. In other words, if we want to purchase or build a new facility, we need to raise those dollars ourselves. What is the difference between Annual Funds and Capital Funds? Annual funds are used for operational costs at a school, such as salaries, enrichments, maintenance and supplies. While Capital funds are used for \"brick and mortar type projects\". North Carolina charter schools only receive operations funding, NOT capital funding. Money for building must come from donations or private borrowing. Are we seeking support from outside the school community? External support will be critical in our effort to raise sufficient funds necessary to purchase the land for our middle school and to build a new building. However, when outside sources are approached, the first question that they ask is \"What have you been able to raise internally?\" It is most important right now that we achieve our goal of 100% participation so that we can better leverage our case outside of our school community. The Fundraising Committee will continue to explore potential donors outside of our internal school community. How will my funds be used? Donations to the Socrates Academy Capital Campaign are used to enhance and grow the schools infrastructure and campus. In the past, the Capital Campaign has helped the school purchase additional land, construct our Middle School facility, and build an all new 4th and 5th grade facility. What is a Matching Gift Program? When a company or corporation offers gift matching it means when an employee makes a charitable contribution to a non-profit organization, the corporation agrees to pay an equal amount to the same non-profit organization. For example, if you are an employee of Wells Fargo, you could donate $50.00 to Socrates Academy monthly by bank draft, and Wells Fargo would donate the same amount. That would mean Socrates Academy would receive $100.00 monthly, resulting in a $1200.00 a year!

{"url": "https://www.socratesacademy.us/academics", "text": "ACADEMICS Socrates Academy OUR SCHOOLPARENTSACADEMICSSUPPORT SOCRATESCAMPUS LIFEATHLETICSMoreACADEMICSThe Academy's bilingual, multicultural curriculum follows both the North Carolina Standard Course of Study (language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, physical education, art, and music) and the National Greek Curriculum Standards (language arts, mathematics, and Greek culture). The curriculum is an innovative research-based curriculum, developed by the Socrates Academy Curriculum Committee, which is made up of several distinguished faculty from UNC Charlotte with expertise in various aspects of education, English and other languages, mathematics, and technology. It is important to note that only a small percentage of the students of the Academy are of Greek heritage, and students from diverse cultures and backgrounds are greatly profiting from this approach. While part of each school day is taught in Greek, no prior knowledge of Greek is required. It is, however, recommended that new students enter the Academy at the earliest grades possible in order to gain the greatest academic benefit. Instruction relies on the Socratic Method to foster critical analytic thinking. The program is characterized by high academic quality and a special emphasis in mathematics, reading, writing, character development, multiculturalism, and early learning of a second language. CurriculumLiteracy Elementary Studentsare taught using abalanced literacy approach to reading.This means that we pull the bestresearch-basedsources to teach reading andphonics.

I am grateful to have the opportunity to lead a school with such determined students, a dedicated staff, and a supportive school community. I feel honored to be part of this school and to support the students and families.My official start date at CSS is Monday, August 17th, so our students and I will have the same first day. Rest assured that I am working with the board and Ms. Garrison to make this transition as smooth as possible. I have been devoted to educating students for eighteen years, working with students ranging in age from 6th through 12th grade in various roles. I started my education career as a middle school counselor, test coordinator, cheer, and softball coach. During this time I worked to make sure that students were growing academically, personally, and socially. After several years in this role, I became interested in what my students were learning and how they learned. This is when I made the switch to school administration; I wanted to focus on the best ways to help students master the curriculum and be successful in the classroom setting. I moved on to become an Assistant Principal at Cary High School for eight years. Most recently, I served as the Instructional Vice Principal at Davis Middle School in Waldorf, Maryland. I am elated to bring my skills as an educational leader to Charlotte Secondary and to collaborate with you as a partner in education to ensure your childs success. I view education as a life-long learning process for students, parents, and faculty alike and look forward to the greatness that will come from the CSS family. More importantly, I bring a belief that students are at the center of all school-related decisions an should be considered in every choice that we make. I am excited to unite my experience, my openness to learn, and my child-centered approach to support our students. Because the relationships between families and the school are vital to the success of our students, I encourage you to become involved in every way possible. I look forward to meeting you soon! In closing, please know that my door is always open to you. I heartily welcome your conversation and positive input throughout this year. Let us always keep our students the primary focus of our work. I look forward to celebrating our collective successes during the 2020-2021 school year. Sincerely, Keisha C.

Regulations: 34 CFR Part 99). This Act was designated to protect the privacy of educational records. Public School Units (PSUs) must annually notify parents and eligible students of their rights under FERPA 34 CFR 99.7 which guides the sharing of student directory information and allows them the option to request that the school not disclose this information. Beginning in February, 2020, parents and guardians must make an intentional decision to opt-in or opt-out of the sharing of information. The purpose is to ensure parents and guardians are aware of opportunities available to them and to assist families with the updating of selections each year.

Additionally, parents/guardians of high school students must select if they want to share contact information with colleges, universities and the military.

This atmosphere provides our students with a variety of experiential learning opportunities. As specified in our charter, we actively recruit students who thrive in a smaller school environment, as well as those who are traditionally under-represented in high school college preparatory programs. Primarily a college and career preparatory school, we gather students from all educational backgrounds and provide them with avenues of enrichment and study that cater to their individual needs. Ultimately our charge is to guide all students in the discovery of their own particular genius, a crucial step in a distinctive life-path. Our History Charlotte Secondary School is a public charter school that opened in 2007 serving students in middle school grades 6-8. Recognized as a School of Distinction in 2011, the school moved to larger facility and expanded to grades 6-12 in 2014. Charlotte Secondary graduated the first senior class in 2016 with 32 of the 36 graduates enrolling in a 2 or 4-year college. Our current senior class exceeds the state average in all 4 college-readiness benchmarks measured by the ACT (English, Math, Reading and Science). Our students continue the tradition of academic excellence set by that first class. Our Mission We are a diverse middle and high school community that focuses on college and career preparation and individually tailored learning opportunities to empower all students to reach their full potential. Our Vision CSS students will be critical thinkers and effective communicators, engaged citizens and life-long learners.

Professional Development Liaison Training Since ESSA took effect, many states now require Homeless Liaisons to complete training and have a certificate of completion on file. While NHA provides staff training on homeless awareness through OnCourse, the Homeless Liaison at each school should complete the state specific training available and the NCHE Webinars. Start Professional Development Homeless Liaisons have a huge role helping so many families and students, but identification of homeless students should not rest on the Liaison alone. All staff at your school may be trained on how to identify homeless students and how to notify the Homeless Liaison of potential homeless students. Federal and state legislation require the Homeless Liaison to conduct staff trainings on these topics annually. This can be accomplished at a staff meeting and documentation such as the agenda or any sign in sheets should be kept as evidence for potential audits. Be sure to take advantage of the readily available presentations located on the NCHE site, or reach out to your State Coordinator for additional resources. 2019 Charlotte Secondary School Site designed & maintained by Red Cape Design Back to top", "depth": 2, "images": [], "files": []},

Charter schools are public schools in that they: Are publicly funded through state and local tax revenue; Do not charge tuition; Are open to all North Carolina residents. Unlike traditional public schools, though, charter schools are operated by non-profit corporations and governed by the corporations Board of Directors rather than the local school board. Also, charter schools are somewhat less regulated than traditional public schools. For example, NC charter schools have more flexibility than traditional public schools with respect to curriculum, teacher salaries and licensure requirements, specifications for school buildings, and purchasing. However, charter schools are subject to oversight by the State Board of Education and the NC Department of Public Instruction. Charter school facilities must meet all local health and safety requirements and charter school students must take the same end-of-grade and end-of-course tests as other public school students in North Carolina. Students who attend charter schools do so by choice. Charter schools, often referred to as under-funded public schools, receive state and local funding on a per student basis as do traditional public schools. Unlike traditional public schools, charter schools receive no funding for buildings, equipment, campus improvements, technology, transportation, food service, or capital expenditures. CSS is a Title 1 school. Please see information below Clickhereto go to the National Charter School Resource Center website for more information about charter schools. What are your guiding principles? Charlotte Secondary Schools core principles are as follows: A fundamental purpose of public education is to maintain and advance our democratic society A rigorous college preparatory education is the best preparation for civic participation, post-secondary education and the modern workplace Diversity is not merely desirable; it is necessary for the accomplishment of our mission A good education should be personalized and engage the whole person Our teachers will be competent, caring professionals who will grow along with our students Family and community engagement is essential for academic achievement A school is always a work in progress; we will pursue continuous improvement through self-assessment and evidence-based practices.

Our school receives funds from the federal government to help students improve in achievement. Title I money provides both extra teachers to work with children and additional funds to purchase materials, supplies, and training opportunities for staff and parents. The best education of students involves partnerships among the home, school, community, and other support agencies. The involvement of parents is important to the school community and to the success of our students. Parent involvement activities will be reviewed annually by parents. The goal is to ensure parents are involved in the planning and implementation of the Title I program at Charlotte Secondary School. Annual Public Meetings Annual Fall and Spring meetings occur to inform parents about parental involvement requirements, school performance, and methods for measuring progress, school facilities and the School-wide Title I program. At the end of the school year, input is solicited from parents to plan, evaluate, and improve the program for next year. Meetings are held throughout the year to train and involve parents in the education of their children. Quarterly meetings are held to enable parents to see our focus for learning, quarterly expectations and data review as well as to involved parents in celebrating the success of our students. Regular Meetings Parents and students are encouraged to participate in Fall in order to gain information about the schools performance the previous year, and to discuss initiatives for improvement for the current year. Teachers and administrators schedule parent/student conference whenever deemed necessary by the school or when requested by the parents. These conferences are held before, during, or after school hours.

To this end, we are in the process of hiring a qualified school bus driver. Families who would like to be considered for bus transportation must complete a request form prior to the beginning of school, August 26, 2019. Once we have received requests, we will coordinate a route with two to three hub stops that will allow us to accommodate the most families. WE anticipate starting bus transportation the second week of school, Tuesday, September 3, 2019. Please understand that providing bus transportationis a huge undertaking in terms of logistics and cost. We anticipate the total cost of operating one bus will cost a total of $25,000-$35,000 a year. And as you may know, charter schools do not receivefunding for transportation. Obviously, given our continuing funding challenges, we must limit our efforts regarding transportation. As such, we encourage all families to consider car-pooling. This process can achieve the same goals while saving money for families and for the school. We look forward to assisting as many families as possible with bus transportation. As we work towards this goal, we ask for patience and understanding as we wont be able to accommodate all requests this school year. Thanks for your support!

While we are working diligently to meet state standards for opening on August 17, 2020, we are still waiting on the state to make some final decisions. On June 8 every public school district in North Carolina received information from the state on safely reopening for the 2020-2021 year. Click here to review the reopening took kit. The State is considering one of three options listed below. That decision will be made by July 1. The three potential options are: Plan A: Minimal Social Distancing Measures Plan B: Moderate Social Distancing Measures (hybrid of plans A & C) Plan C: Complete Distance Learning What is CSS doing to create each plan? We are working with all CSS staff to meet all state requirements for each of the states 3 plans. When will families be notified of how school will reopen (plan A, B or C)? Once the state has determined what plan they are choosing to implement, on or around July 1st. CSS will release its plans within the same time period. Please understand that this is constantly fluid situation and the States deadline may shift. CSS will continue to communicate all and any changes as soon as possible.
