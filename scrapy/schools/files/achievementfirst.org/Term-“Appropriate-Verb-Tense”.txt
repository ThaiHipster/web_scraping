Term: “Appropriate Verb Tense”

Deﬁnition:
When writing is in the appropriate verb tense, the verb being used accurately represents both what is being
written about and when something happened. More speciﬁcally, historical events are written about in the past
tense, and literature is written about in the present tense. This is more challenging to maintain when history
and literature are written about in the same paper (see the allegory papers).
