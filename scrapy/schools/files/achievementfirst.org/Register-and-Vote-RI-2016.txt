Secretary of State 

Dear Rhode Island Voter:

As Secretary of State, I have pledged to modernize elections in Rhode 
Island and make sure that elections in our state are fair, fast and accurate. 
Since taking office in 2015, I have been working diligently to make it easier 
for you to be a voter.

First, on August 1, I officially launched the state’s first Online Voter 
Registration portal at vote.ri.gov and in Spanish at vota.ri.gov. Eligible 
Rhode Island voters can now easily and securely register to vote or update 
their registration information online with just a few clicks.

Second, for the first time in nearly 20 years, Rhode Island voters will use 
new voting equipment during the elections this fall. The voting machines 
feature an enhanced user interface and utilize wireless connectivity that 
allows for faster results reporting on election night. By updating our voting 
equipment, we are updating Democracy's infrastructure.

I am committed to engaging and empowering all Rhode Islanders to help 
move our great state forward. Your vote is absolutely critical to the success 
of our Ocean State. This guide will help you to be informed, be engaged, 
and be a voter. Please help me get this information to as many people as 
possible by sharing it with your friends and family.

If you need additional information, please contact our Elections Division 
at 401-222-2340, TTY 711 or visit us during normal business hours at 148 
West River Street in Providence or write us at elections@sos.ri.gov.

See you at the polls!

Nellie M. Gorbea
Secretary of State

How to register to vote and be a voter in Rhode IslandELECTIONS IN 2016

Party Primaries
Primary election
Primaries are elections held by political parties to decide who will represent their party in the general 
election. The winner of the primary election must still compete with other candidates in the general 
election.

Political parties will hold primary elections for federal, state, and local offices on September 13, 2016. 
Some cities/towns also hold non-partisan primaries. Please contact your local board of canvassers for more 
information (see page 20 for contact information).

Voting in a primary
Anyone registered to vote in Rhode Island can vote in a primary election so long as their party is having 
a primary. If you are affiliated with a political party, you may only vote in that party’s primary. Unaffiliated, 
also known as independent, voters can vote in any party primary but, by casting a vote in a party primary, 
you automatically become affiliated with that party.
To return to an unaffiliated status, you may request a “disaffiliation form” from poll workers and fill it out 
before leaving the polling place. You will officially return to your unaffiliated status in 90 days.

Party Affiliations
You have the option of affiliating with any recognized political party when you register to vote or update 
your voter registration information. You can do this at any time, but it must be done at least 90 days before 
voting in a primary. If you do not choose a party affiliation, you will be an unaffiliated voter.
The deadline to disaffiliate for the Primary on September 13, 2016 was June 15, 2016.

Races on the Ballot
The names of the candidates for each federal and state race appear first on the ballot with their party 
affiliation listed directly beneath their names. The federal and state races appear in the following order: 
President and Vice President, Representative in Congress, State Senator and State Representative.
In most cities/towns, local races will appear next on the ballot. In some races the names of the candidates 
appear on the ballot along with their party affiliation. Some races are labeled as “non-partisan” or “without 
party marks or designation”. In those races, the candidate’s party affiliation will not appear on the ballot.
Your ballot may also include races where more than one person is to be elected. In those races, you will see 
instructions such as “Vote for any 2” indicating that you may vote for up to 2 candidates in that race, “Vote 
for any 3” indicating that you may vote for up to 3 candidates in that race, and so forth.
The state constitutional amendments and questions are then listed on the ballot. In most cases, the 
questions start in the first column on the backside of the ballot. Where applicable, local questions follow 
the state constitutional amendments and questions and are printed on a yellow background. In some 
cases, questions will not fit on the backside of the ballot and you will be issued an additional ballot.

Your Voter Rights
You have the right to:

›  Keep who you vote for a secret 

Your voter registration and some other voting documents, like a mail ballot application, are public records. 
No one however, not even elections officials, can find out who you voted for once your ballot is accepted.

›  Cast a provisional ballot, even if your name is not on the voter list or you do not have an acceptable 
form of ID, as long as you are registered to vote 
You have the right to request a provisional ballot if you are a qualified, registered voter and your name 
cannot be found on the voter list when you arrive at your designated polling place on Election Day, or if 
you do not bring a current and valid acceptable photo ID to the polling place.

›  Vote for President and Vice President even if you did not register in time 

Even if you did not meet the registration deadline, you may vote for President and Vice President 
only. Inquire about same-day registration at your local board of canvassers (see page 20 for contact 
information).

›  Have assistance in the voting booth on Election Day 

You can request the assistance of a bipartisan pair of poll workers. Federal and state laws allow voters who 
are blind, disabled, or unable to read or write to bring a person of their choice into the voting booth.  
An affidavit must be completed. See page 18 for more information.

›  Vote by mail 

If you cannot vote in person, you can request a mail ballot by visiting your local board of canvassers or 
visiting the RI Department of State’s website at www.sos.ri.gov for an application.

Violations of state election law
Any attempt to interfere with your right to vote or to unduly influence your vote is a crime. It is a crime to 
try to make you vote a certain way by making threats or offering gifts. It is also against the law to force you 
to reveal your vote once you have cast your ballot. Contact your local board of canvassers if anyone tries to 
interfere with your right to vote.
It is also against the law for you to make any false statements on your voter registration form or ballot 
application. Voting or trying to vote when you are not eligible or helping another person to vote fraudulently 
are crimes punishable by law.

Eligibility
Elections officials need to know a few things about you, such as your eligibility to vote and where you live,

You can register to vote on Election Day but you will only be able to vote for President and Vice President on 
November 8. You will not be able to vote in any state, local, or other federal races. You can only register and 
vote on Election Day at the location designated by your local board of canvassers.

Register to Vote

registration information online at vote.ri.gov. If you have never registered to vote in Rhode Island, you will

Acknowledgement Notice
When you register to vote or update your voter registration information, your local board of canvassers will 
send you an acknowledgement notice at the address associated with your voter registration. You will also be 
notified by mail if your registration does not meet the requirements for any reason.
Be sure to contact your local board of canvassers if you do not receive the acknowledgement notice within 
three weeks of registering to vote. If the Post Office cannot deliver the notice to the address on your voter

Provisional Voting
Provisional voting is a process to ensure that all registered voters are allowed to participate in the election 
process. 
When do I cast a provisional ballot?
If you believe you were left off the voter list, do not have an acceptable form of photo identification, or if you 
are otherwise prevented from voting by error, you will be allowed to cast a provisional ballot. If you are not 
offered a provisional ballot by the poll worker, you should request one. No voter should leave their polling 
place without first casting a provisional ballot.
First, you will complete a provisional ballot application containing a statement that you are registered and 
eligible to vote. You then complete a ballot, which you seal inside the envelope provided. The envelope and 
your ballot go to elections officials who will determine whether or not you are eligible to vote.
If the official determines that you are eligible, your ballot will be counted with all other ballots in your polling 
place. The secrecy of your vote will be preserved at all times.
Track my provisional ballot
Your provisional ballot will be assigned a serial number, which will be provided to you before you leave the polling 
place. In most cases you will be able to check whether or not the ballot was counted 48 hours after the election 
by going to the Board of Elections website at elections.ri.gov or by contacting your local board of canvassers.

Troubleshooting
What happens if I vote for too many candidates?
The voting equipment is programmed to notify you if you vote for more candidates than allowed by law. A poll 
worker will ask you to remove the ballot and complete several additional ovals on the ballot. Your old ballot 
is then completely voided and sealed for your voting privacy. You will be given a new ballot and directed to a 
voting booth to complete it.

Can someone help me if I have questions on marking my ballot?
A poll worker will explain how to mark your ballot if you ask. The cover of the secrecy folder and the inside wall 
of the voting booth will also contain instructions on how to mark your ballot. You may also take this guide or 
any other materials into the voting booth to assist you in voting.
Per state law, anyone can assist the voter unless they are the voter’s employer or agent of that employer, or an 
officer or agent of the voter’s union.
You can request the assistance of a bipartisan pair of poll workers. Federal and state laws allow voters who 
are blind, disabled or unable to read or write to bring a person of their choice into the voting booth. The poll 
worker will have an affidavit that must be completed. 

Why am I listed as inactive?
If you live at a different address from the one shown on the voting list, or if you are listed as “inactive” because 
mail sent to your address has been returned by the Post Office as undeliverable, you will need to fill out and 
sign an additional affirmation form before voting.
