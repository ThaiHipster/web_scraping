Term: “Paraphrased”

Deﬁnition:
Paraphrased evidence is evidence that is from the text that is in a scholar’s own words. Scholars should
capture the full meaning of what they are paraphrasing without altering, omitting, or adding to that evidence.
While limits around how many strings of words can be used in the same order without using quotes (say 3)
can lead to artiﬁcial paraphrasing, words, phrases, and structures that seem artiﬁcial for a scholar to use
should be looked into.
