Term: “Insightful”
Definition: Clear, critical and complex ideas that are outside of the scope of class discussion. These ideas 
are “new” to the student and demonstrate a strong depth of understanding with particular sensitivity to 
nuances and/or alternative readings within the text / content.

“Creon most closely fits with Aristotle’s definition 
of a tragic hero because of his mistakes, his pride, 
his great downfall, and his suffering.”

Analysis: This thesis statement is lists the exact 
criterion that Creon fits, it does not hint at any 
nuance of analysis that explains why Creon, as 
opposed to other characters, particularly fits the 
definition. The criterion listed are stock, pre-
determined criterion and do not demonstrate any 
thinking outside of the core of class discussion.

“In “Ozamandias” and “The Second Coming,” 
Percy Shelley and William Yeats seek to 
illuminate and define the world around them 
by exploring the struggle between order and 
chaos, yet both ultimately come to very different 
conclusions... Yet not only do Shelley and Yeats 
reach very different conclusions, but there 
is almost no overlap in the ways both poets 
use poetic form and artistry to communicate 
meaning.”

Analysis: The statement is also nuanced in the 
sense it makes a small but important distinction 
between how the poets are similar and different 
-- i.e., they both illuminate and define the world 
around them by a common theme (the struggle 
between order and chaos), yet they use different 
poetic forms in different ways to express their 
meanings and come to different conclusions. 
These statements are insightful because this 
level of nuance was clearly not discussed in 
class; this author is going above and beyond and 
incorporating “new” ideas into their paper.
