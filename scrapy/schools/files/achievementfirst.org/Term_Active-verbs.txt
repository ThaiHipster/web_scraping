Term: “Active verbs”
Definition: Verbs, not adjectives (though often relied upon by novice writers) drive all sentences; to 
improve clarity and concision, we must teach active verbs.  Students select generic all-purpose verbs such 
as “deal with” or “show,” which quickly become meaningless and repetitive and convey no analytical 
meaning.

“Said” becomes more descriptive as “hypothesized” and when “shows” becomes “represents” the reader is 
able to make more – and more specific – meaning. 

For the reader, “Cheswick dealt with” or “Figure 4 shows” are far less meaningful than “Cheswick 
hypothesized” or “Figure 4 represents.” As always, you should choose exact words in favor of nonspecific 
ones, especially when you can use an active verb.

Please note that the use of active verbs often implies active voice although this is not always true.
