Term: “Blocking”
Definition: Blocking is when the author selects a large amount of texts and sets it apart from the paragraph 
by moving the margins in on the left and right.

Example
Example 1: “Meyer Wolfsheim is the biggest predator to Gatsby. Meyer Wolfsheim remembers when 
Gatsby was just:

A young major just out of the army and covered with medals he got in the war. He was so hard up 
he had to keep wearing his uniform because he couldn’t buy some regular clothes. First time I saw 
him was when he come into Winebrenners’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a job. He 
hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days. ‘Come on have some lunch with me,’ I said. He ate more 
than four dollars’ worth of food in a half an hour.
‘Did you start him in business?’ I inquired
‘Start him! I made him’ (170-171).

Gatsby is a target. Wolfsheim “made him” infers that if it were not for him, Gatsby would not be where 
he is.”

Example 2: “There, Odysseus explained his experience:

Any crewman who ate the lotus, the honey-sweet fruit, 
lost all desire to send a message back, much less return, 
their only wish to linger there with Lotus-eaters, 
grazing on lotus, all memory of the journey home 
dissolved forever. But I brought them back, back 
to the hollow ships, and streaming tears-I forced them, 
hauled them under the rowing benches (IX, 106-112)

Many would argue that this highlights how even though Odysseus verbalized it in an arrogant way, he 
actually helped his crew by pulling them away from addictive fruit. Yet upon further analysis, this 
expresses his desire to be seen as the hero, making him appear as arrogant.”
