AF Brooklyn High

AF East Brooklyn High

n  AF Brooklyn High serves predominantly Black students from 

Brooklyn. Approximately 60% of AF Brooklyn High students will be 
the first in their families to attend a four-year college or university.

n  Because of their longer academic day and year, students at AF 

Brooklyn High receive nearly 400 hours of additional classroom time 
compared to their peers in traditional New York City district schools.

n  AF Brooklyn High’s rigorous curriculum emphasizes core academic 

subjects: literature, composition, history, math, and science. 
Students are required to take four full years of coursework in each 
of these subjects. 

n  All students take at least one Advanced Placement course, and 
approximately half of the school’s students take two or more AP 
courses.

THE CLASS OF 2020 IS AF BROOKLYN HIGH’S EIGHTH GRADUATING CLASS

GRADING POLICY & PHILOSOPHY
 
n  AF Brooklyn High uses a 100-point grading scale, with 70 as 

the minimum grade to pass a course and 50 as the lowest 
published grade. Weighted Grade Point Average (GPA) is 
calculated as the arithmetic average (total quality points 
divided by credits) of all weighted courses taken.

n  The faculty strives to protect against grade inflation; 

consequently, “A”s and “B”s are hard-earned. While AF 
Brooklyn High students may have overall lower GPAs than 
their peers in traditional district schools, this is not a reflection 
of their academic tenacity or ultimate mastery. Rather, it is a 
reflection of the high expectations to which students are held.

COLLEGE MATRICULATION & PERSISTENCE 

Achievement First seeks to disrupt the “norm,” in a country 
where enduring inequities mean just 9% of students from low-
income families earn a college degree by age 24. Our graduates’ 
projected college completion rate is 55% —six times the national 
average—and we’re working hard to ensure that rate grows until it 
equals, then surpasses, the graduation rate for our country’s most 
affluent students.

AF Brooklyn High supports graduates beyond high school by:

n  Matching all students with a college success counselor who 

provides individualized outreach and support.

n     Building cohorts of AF graduates at schools with high expected 

college completion rates for students of color.

BEYOND ACADEMICS

All students take elective courses that are embedded in the
school day. In addition, 75% of AF Brooklyn High students
participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

During their high school careers, members of the Class of 2020
will participate in at least three summer programs, allowing them 
to augment their rigorous academic experience with exploratory 
learning experiences beyond the classroom. Sixty percent of 
students participated in a pre-college summer program and 75% 
of students participated in a summer internship.
