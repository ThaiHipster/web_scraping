AF’S NEW YORK HIGH SCHOOLS

AF East Brooklyn High

Achievement First University Prep High School, a college-
preparatory public charter school in Bushwick, Brooklyn, 
provides students from historically-underserved communities 
with a top-quality education geared to prepare them for 
the rigor or college work and help them flourish on college 
campuses. AF University Prep’s approach includes an 
intensive college-preparatory course of study and a focus on 
building the foundational skills essential for college success.

n  AF University Prep serves predominantly Black and 

Latinx students from Brooklyn. Approximately 70% of AF 
University Prep students will be the first in their families to 
attend a four-year college or university.

n  Because of the longer academic day and year, students at 

AF University Prep receive nearly 400 hours of additional 
classroom time compared to their peers in traditional New 
York City district schools.

n  AF University Prep’s rigorous curriculum emphasizes core 
academic subjects: literature, seminar, history, math, and 
science. Students are required to take four full years of 
coursework in each of these subjects. 

n  All AF University Prep students take at least six Advanced 

Placement courses, and approximately 95% of the 
school’s students will take seven AP courses by the time 
they graduate from AF University Prep.

THE CLASS OF 2020 IS AF UNIVERSITY PREP’S FOURTH GRADUATING CLASS

GRADING POLICY & PHILOSOPHY
 
n  AF University Prep uses a 100-point grading scale, with 70 

as the minimum grade to pass a course and 50 as the lowest 
published grade. Weighted Grade Point Average (GPA) is 
calculated as the arithmetic average (total quality points 
divided by credits) of all weighted courses taken.

n  The faculty strives to protect against grade inflation; 

consequently, “A”s and “B”s are hard-earned. While AF 
University Prep students may have overall lower GPAs than 
their traditional district peers, this is not a reflection of their 
academic tenacity or ultimate mastery. Rather, it is a reflection 
of the high expectations to which students are held.

COLLEGE MATRICULATION & PERSISTENCE 

Achievement First seeks to disrupt the “norm,” in a country 
where enduring inequities mean just 9% of students from low-
income families earn a college degree by age 24. Our graduates’ 
projected college completion rate is 55%—six times the national 
average—and we’re working hard to ensure that rate grows until it 
equals, then surpasses, the graduation rate for our country’s most 
affluent students.

AF University Prep supports graduates beyond high school by:

n  Matching all students with a college success counselor who 

provides individualized outreach and support.

n   Building cohorts of AF graduates at schools with high expected 

college completion rates for students of color.

70%

STUDENTS WILL BE THE FIRST 
IN THEIR FAMILIES TO ATTEND COLLEGE.

BEYOND ACADEMICS

All students take elective courses that are embedded in the
school day. In addition, 75% of AF University Prep students
participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

During their high school careers, members of the Class of 2020
will participate in at least three summer programs, allowing them 
to augment their rigorous academic experience with exploratory 
learning experiences beyond the classroom. 50% of students 
participated in a pre-college summer program and 70% of 
students participated in a summer internship.
