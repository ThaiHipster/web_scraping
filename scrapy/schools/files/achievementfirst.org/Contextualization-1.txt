Contextualization 1

Analysis: Lit - Paired Passage
Contextualization: Framing

This paper scores a 1 for framing because there is no attempt to frame the argument. The reader does not know who Luke is, what war
he is referring to, where this takes place, or what texts are being considered.
Contextualization: Context

This paper scores a 1 for context because there is no attempt made to contextualize the evidence. It is difﬁcult to tell what is evidence
since most of the writing is vague and general and any possible evidence is paraphrased (being, “under-age for war,” and that “the bird
brought the letter saying that the war was over early”). Regardless, if these are pieces of evidence, there is no attempt to contextualize
them.
