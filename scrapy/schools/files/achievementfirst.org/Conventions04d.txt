Analysis: Lit - Yeats.Order of Chaos

ABSTRACT/SUmmARY:
The chief problem in this essay is vague pronoun reference (mainly “this” as the subject of the sentence 
and “it.”)  There are more errors in this area than pages, so the paper can not score a five.
Examples of vague pronouns:
“However, Shelley takes it a step further.” 
“This adds emotion to the poem.” 
“This not only compliments his obscure vision...”
In addition, there are several plain typos (note the misspelling of Shelley in the first paragraph) and errors 
in punctuation in front of direct quotations.
