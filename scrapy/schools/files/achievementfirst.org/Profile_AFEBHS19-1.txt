SCHOOL OVERVIEW

The mission of Achievement First East Brooklyn High School, 
a college-preparatory public charter school in Brooklyn, New 
York, is to provide students from historically-underserved 
communities with a top-quality education to prepare them for 
the rigor of college work and help them flourish on college 
campuses. AF East Brooklyn High’s approach includes a rigorous, 
college-preparatory course of study, tutoring, intensive college 
counseling, and robust athletic and elective programs.

n  AF East Brooklyn High serves predominantly Black and Latinx 
students from Brooklyn. Many AF East Brooklyn High students 
will be the first in their families to attend a four-year college      
or university.

n  Because of their longer academic day and year, students at 
AF East Brooklyn High receive nearly 400 hours of additional 
classroom time compared to their peers in traditional New York 
City district schools.

n  AF East Brooklyn High’s rigorous curriculum emphasizes core 

academic subjects: literature, composition, history, math, 
and science. Students are required to take four full years of 
coursework in each of these subjects.

n  All students have taken rigorous humanities course offerings by 

junior year including AP Seminar and AP Research.

GRADING POLICY & PHILOSOPHY
 
n  AF East Brooklyn High uses a 100-point grading scale, with 

70 as the minimum grade to pass a course and 50 as the 
lowest published grade. Weighted Grade Point Average 
(GPA) is calculated as the arithmetic average (total quality 
points divided by credits) of all weighted courses taken. 

n  The faculty strives to protect against grade inflation; 

consequently, “A”s and “B”s are hard-earned. While AF East 
Brooklyn High students may have overall lower GPAs than 
their peers in traditional district schools, this is not a reflection 
of their academic tenacity or ultimate mastery. Rather, it is a 
reflection of the high expectations to which students are held.

COLLEGE MATRICULATION & PERSISTENCE 

Achievement First seeks to disrupt the “norm,” in a country 
where enduring inequities mean just 9% of students from 
low-income families earn a college degree by age 24. Our 
graduates’ projected college completion rate is 55% —six times 
the national average—and we’re working hard to ensure that rate 
grows until it equals, then surpasses, the graduation rate for our 
country’s most affluent students.

AF East Brooklyn High will continue to support graduates beyond 
high school by:

n  Matching all students with a college success counselor who 

provides individualized outreach and support.

n  Building cohorts of AF graduates at schools with high 

expected college completion rates for students of color.

AF East Brooklyn High’s College 
Seminar course exposes scholars to 
rigorous college-level writing. 
Students explore topics like Black 
Arts Movement and The Latin American 
Experience through research and writing. 

BEYOND ACADEMICS

All students take elective courses that are embedded in the
school day. In addition, 75% of AF East Brooklyn High students
participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

During their high school careers, members of the Class of 2020
will participate in at least three summer programs, allowing them 
to augment their rigorous academic experience with exploratory 
learning experiences beyond the classroom. Sixty percent of 
students participated in a pre-college summer program and 75% 
of students participated in a summer internship.
