Term: “Clear, Sufﬁcient Background Information”

Deﬁnition:
Background information is clear and as concise as possible. It quickly informs the reader about the works
cited and information he will need to know to understand the paper, but does not go into unnecessary detail.
There are no redundancies, inaccuracies, inconsistencies, superﬂuous additions, or minor omissions.
Someone ﬂuent in English but without any prior knowledge about the content or text would have enough
information to understand the argument being presented.
