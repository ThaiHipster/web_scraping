Term: “Complex Sentences”

Deﬁnition:
A complex sentence has an independent clause joined by one or more dependent clauses. A complex sentence
always has a subordinator such as because, since, after, although, or when or a relative pronoun such as that,
who, or which.
A. When he handed in his homework, he forgot to give the teacher the last page.
B. The teacher returned the homework after she noticed the error. 
C. The students are studying because they have a test tomorrow.
D. After they ﬁnished studying, Juan and Maria went to the movies.
E. Juan and Maria went to the movies after they ﬁnished studying.
ANALYSIS: When a complex sentence begins with a subordinator such as sentences A and D, a comma is
required at the end of the dependent clause. When the independent clause begins the sentence with
subordinators in the middle as in sentences B, C, and E, no comma is required. If a comma is placed before
the subordinators in sentences B, C, and E, it is wrong.
Note that sentences D and E are the same except sentence D begins with the dependent clause which is
followed by a comma, and sentence E begins with the independent clause which contains no comma. The
comma after the dependent clause in sentence D is required, and experienced listeners of English will often
hear a slight pause there. In sentence E, however, there will be no pause when the independent clause begins
the sentence.
