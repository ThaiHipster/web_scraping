Term: “Parallel Structure”

Deﬁnition:
Parallel structure means using the same pattern of words to show that two or more ideas have the same level
of importance. This can happen at the word, phrase, or clause level. The usual way to join parallel structures
is with the use of coordinating conjunctions such as "and" or "or."
