Term: “Chunking”

Deﬁnition:
Chunking is when the author removes words and phrases from the middle of a quote to focus on the juicy
parts of the quote and to make it more readable. Example: "Chunking is… an important skill." "Chunking can
also occur" when authors chop up the quote so they can "more easily incorporate it into a clear sentence."
