Analysis: Lit - Rumble Fish
Style: Register

This paper scores a 2 for register because there is an attempt to write in a formal tone. There is no slang or text-speak. The scholar does
sometimes write in ﬁrst person (“I think”, “I say”), but there is a clear attempt at a formal tone. The phrase “crew of guys” is less than
formal. The length of piece prevents the scholar from being able to establish and maintain a formal tone.
