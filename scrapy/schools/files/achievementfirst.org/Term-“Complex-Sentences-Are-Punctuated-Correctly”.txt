Term: “Complex Sentences Are Punctuated
Correctly”

Deﬁnition:
Complex sentences are composed of 1 or more dependent clauses and 1 or more independent clauses. If the
introductory clause is dependent, it should be separated by a comma from the independent clause. For
example: Because road construction has hindered travel around town, many people have opted to ride
bicycles or walk to work. If the dependent clause follows the independent clause, it should not be followed by
a comma. (See http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/566/02/ for more examples)
