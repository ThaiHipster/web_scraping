AF HARTFORD HIGH IS RANKED THE 
#3 HIGH SCHOOL IN CONNECTICUT 
BY U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT.

SCHOOL OVERVIEW

The mission of Achievement First Hartford High School, 
a college-preparatory public charter school in Hartford, 
Connecticut, is to provide students from historically-
underserved communities with a top-quality education to 
prepare them for the rigor of college work and help them 
flourish on college campuses. AF Hartford High’s approach 
includes a rigorous, college-preparatory course of study, 
tutoring, intensive college counseling, and robust athletic and 
elective programs.

n  AF Hartford High serves predominantly Black and Latinx 

students from Hartford. Our communities face a pronounced 
racial achievement gap, a factor that contributes to 
Connecticut’s troubling status as the state with the largest 
achievement gap in the nation. Approximately 85% of AF 
Hartford High students will be the first in their families to 
attend a four-year college or university.

n  Because of their longer academic day and year, students 
at AF Hartford High receive nearly 400 hours of additional 
classroom time compared to their peers in traditional 
Hartford district schools.

n  AF Hartford High’s rigorous curriculum emphasizes core 
academic subjects: literature, composition, history, math, 
and science. Students are required to take four full years of 
coursework in each of these subjects.

THE CLASS OF 2020 IS AF HARTFORD HIGH’S FIFTH GRADUATING CLASS

GRADING POLICY & PHILOSOPHY
 
n  AF Hartford High uses a 100-point grading scale, with 70 

as the minimum grade to pass a course and 50 as the 
lowest published grade. Weighted Grade Point Average 
(GPA) is calculated as the arithmetic average (total quality 
points divided by credits) of all weighted courses taken. 

n  The faculty strives to protect against grade inflation; 

consequently, “A”s and “B”s are hard-earned. While AF 
Hartford High students may have overall lower GPAs 
than their peers in traditional district schools, this is not a 
reflection of their academic tenacity or ultimate mastery. 
Rather, it is a reflection of the high expectations to which 
students are held.

COLLEGE MATRICULATION & PERSISTENCE 

Achievement First seeks to disrupt the “norm,” in a country 
where enduring inequities mean just 9% of students from low-
income families earn a college degree by age 24. Our graduates’ 
projected college completion rate is 55%—six times the national 
average—and we’re working hard to ensure that rate grows until it 
equals, then surpasses, the graduation rate for our country’s most 
affluent students.

AF Hartford High supports graduates beyond high school by:

n  Matching all students with a college success counselor who 

provides individualized outreach and support.

n     Building cohorts of AF graduates at schools with high expected 
    college completion rates for students of color.

85%

OF AF HARTFORD HIGH 
STUDENTS WILL BE THE FIRST 

IN THEIR FAMILIES TO ATTEND COLLEGE.

BEYOND ACADEMICS

All students take elective courses that are embedded in the 
school day. In addition, 75% of AF Hartford High students 
participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

During their high school careers, members of the Class of 2020 
will participate in at least three summer enrichment programs, 
allowing them to augment their rigorous academic experience 
with exploratory learning experiences beyond the classroom. 
35% of students participated in a pre-college summer program 
and 63% of students participated in a summer internship.
