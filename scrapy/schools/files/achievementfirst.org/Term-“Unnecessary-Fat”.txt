Term: “Unnecessary Fat”

Deﬁnition:
Writing with unnecessary fat, while not having extraneous expressions or repetition of ideas, still feels wordy
and clunky at times because there would have been a more concise way to make the same point. Excellent
writing is devoid of both repetition of ideas and wordiness; this term addresses that wordiness.
