Term: “Generic Blends”

Deﬁnition:
A blend is an introductory phrase or dependent clause before a piece of evidence. The purpose of a blend is to
more smoothly blend the evidence into the paragraph and to avoid dropping in quotes abruptly. Generic
blends include phrases like: “In the text,” and, “According to the article.” While these phrases provide some
transition into the evidence, they are generic and could apply to any number of pieces of evidence. There is
nothing speciﬁc to the text or evidence revealed in these blends.
