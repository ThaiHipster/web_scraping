Term: “Provides Closure”

Deﬁnition:
When a conclusion provides closure, it brings the paper to an end, summing up the key ideas of the paper
without simply repeating them, reminds the reader why this matters, and leaves a reader with a ﬁnal thought.
These sections are not choppy; the ﬂow seamlessly into each other.
