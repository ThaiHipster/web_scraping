Term: “Concluding Statement or Section”

Deﬁnition:
This section or statement brings the paper together. While ideally, it should not simply restate what has
already been said, but should emphasize the ideas that the writer wants to have stick with the reader, at the 2
threshold, the presence of this statement or section meets the standard. A concluding statement or section that
‘links to the introduction’ goes beyond restating the thesis and/or assertions.
