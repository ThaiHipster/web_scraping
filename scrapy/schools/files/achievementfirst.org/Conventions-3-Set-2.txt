Conventions 3 (Set 2)

Analysis: Lit - Rumble Fish
Conventions: Spelling

This paper scores a 3 for spelling due to the homophone weak; this was from the text, so it is also a misspelled word from the text.
Given the brevity of this response, this keeps the paper at a 3. While “dennys” and “rusty” are miscopied, they are also errors in
capitalization and possession, which are reﬂected in other places in the rubric.
