Term: “3rd Person Plural Phrasing”

Deﬁnition:
Third person writing is a more objective structure than 1st or 2nd person. It is neither written from the
author’s personal perspective (I, We), nor does it directly address the reader (you, yours).
Third person plural uses the pronouns they, them, and their, and refers to third-person objects and subjects .
