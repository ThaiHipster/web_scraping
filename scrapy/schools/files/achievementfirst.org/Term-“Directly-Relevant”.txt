Term: “Directly Relevant”

Deﬁnition:
Directly relevant evidence goes beyond just being related to the sub-argument. Directly relevant evidence
strongly and speciﬁcally illustrates the sub-argument at hand. While this rubric does not use the language
‘best evidence’, directly relevant evidence does not leave the reader questioning if better evidence was
available.
