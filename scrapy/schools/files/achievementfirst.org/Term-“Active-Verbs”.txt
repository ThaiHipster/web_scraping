Term: “Active Verbs”

Deﬁnition:
Verbs, not adjectives (though often relied upon by novice writers) drive all sentences; to improve clarity and
concision, we must teach active verbs. Students select generic all-purpose verbs such as "deal with" or
"show," which quickly become meaningless and repetitive and convey no analytical meaning.
“Said” becomes more descriptive as “hypothesized” and when “shows” becomes “represents” the reader is
able to make more – and more speciﬁc – meaning.
For the reader, "Cheswick dealt with" or "Figure 4 shows" are far less meaningful than "Cheswick
hypothesized" or "Figure 4 represents." As always, you should choose exact words in favor of nonspeciﬁc
ones, especially when you can use an active verb.
Please note that the use of active verbs often implies active voice although this is not always true.
