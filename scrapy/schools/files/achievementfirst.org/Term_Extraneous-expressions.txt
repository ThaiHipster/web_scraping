Term: “Extraneous expressions”
Definition: While many words and phrases can fit under the extraneous expressions category, we consider 
a small set of repeat offenders “extraneous expressions” for the sake of the HS Writing Rubric. These 
are the phrases that we want to eliminate from student writing first and so these are the phrases we will 
consider extraneous:

Example

Non-Example

“Baca states in the first stanza, ‘the cold cannot 
bite through’ (6). The hard ‘c’ sound is putting 
an end to something. This shows that every bad 
thing that is being done to them will not bring 
them down.”

Analysis: “This shows” is one of the worst repeat 
offenders within the extraneous expressions 
category as defined. A noun phrase must always 
follow this, otherwise it is a vague pronoun (what 
is the student referring to with the word this?). 
Additionally, “shows” is a weak, overused word.

Instead of “This shows”, the author could have 
written, “This alliteration emphasizes”.

“In I Am Offering This Poem, by Jimmy Santiago 
Baca, the poet is giving the idea that love is 
providing you with all that you need, for example 
guidance and comfort.”

Analysis: While the phrase, “is giving the idea 
that” is certainly extra and not necessary, we will 
not consider it an “extraneous expression” within 
the rubric. This error has more to do with active 
verbs and syntax that an elimination of extraneous 
expressions.
