Term: “Content of paragraph is generally
appropriate”

Deﬁnition:
A paragraph with generally appropriate content goes beyond having the majority of sentences related to the
same topic; it includes a topic sentence or assertion, adequate evidence (paraphrased or quoted), an attempt at
interpretation (even if restates the evidence), and a conclusion to that paragraph. While the order should be
primarily logical, it does not need to be formulaic (although it often is a strong place to start). Paragraphs
missing these pieces do not have generally appropriate content, although generally can be assessed in two
ways:

1.  If two out of three body paragraphs have these elements in a logical way, it would meet the generally
(45%-65%) criteria.
2.  If each individual body paragraph meets 45%-65% of the criteria. An example of this could be a body
paragraph without adequate evidence or a body paragraph without a concluding sentence. This could
also account for a paragraph that includes something that is not relevant to the topic of that paragraph.
3.  If multiple paragraphs are missing more than one of these elements, the content of the paragraphs is not
generally appropriate.
