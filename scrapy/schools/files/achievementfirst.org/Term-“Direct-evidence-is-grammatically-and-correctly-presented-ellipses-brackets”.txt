Term: “Direct evidence is grammatically and
correctly presented (ellipses, brackets)”

Deﬁnition:
Use a colon when introducing a quotation with a full independent clause (one that can stand on its own).

Emily feels frustrated by his response: “Is there someone else that we can talk to?”

Use an ellipsis (three periods with spaces between: … ) to indicate an omission in a quotation (though it is
not necessary to use an ellipsis when omitting words at the beginning of a quote unless you are using a block
quote format).

“The kind of intelligence a genius has … leaps with ellipses.”

When you want to omit one or more full sentences, use a period and a space before the three ellipsis dots.

“Hatred paralyzes life. … Hatred darkens life; love illuminates it.”

Use square brackets to add a word, change a pronoun, or change a verb tense in the quote.
