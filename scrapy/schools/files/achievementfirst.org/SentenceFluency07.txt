SENTENCE FLUENCY 7

Analysis: Lit - Yeats.Order of Chaos

ABSTRACT/SUmmARY:
Overall, the paper’s sentence fluency is effective, varied, and precise. There are some clunky spots, but 
they are exceptions and do not unduly hinder the paper.
The paper cannot score an 8 because the sentences are not overwhelmingly precise and accurate.

CRITERION 1: FLUENCY
Overall, the paper shows strong variance of precise and correct sentence structure; it is not overwhelming 
in the sense that precision of writing isn’t the main strength of (and takeaway from) the paper, but it’s 
certainly college-level, excellent writing. The introduction is a good example of this.

CRITERION 2: CONCISION
A judicious editor could split many sentences and exercise better concision. Examples (with suggested 
corrections) below:
Concision
“Yeats gives the reader as vague a notion of where the beast is as possible.”

--> “The beast’s location is purposefully vague.”

“The description of the beast and the broken structure of the stanza suggests that Yeats might be more 
troubled less by the disease of chaos than the cure of total objectivity.”

--> “The beast’s description and broken stanza structure suggests Yeats’ true qualms lie not with the 
disease of chaos, but the cure of total objectivity.”

“Yeats uses a broken, unfinished feeling structure and rhyme scheme...”
--> “Yeats uses a broken, unfinished structure and rhyme scheme...”

“...ages and ages to build up and establish”

--> “ages to establish”

“And this vertical symmetry greatly enhances the meaning of the poem: that the segment of the poem 
glorifying the statue is sandwiched between two segments of the poem glorifying the desert implies that 
the immortality represented by the desert is the true authority and supreme order compared to which man’s 
achievements are insignificant, and not the other way around.”

-->”This vertical symmetry enhances the poem’s core message: immortality, represented by the 
desert, reigns supreme (by physically buffering and suppressing the lines glorifying the statue); man’s 
achievements (the line-buffered, decaying statue) are ultimately insignificant.”

However, despite these examples, the overall concision in the paper is efficient and effective:

Shelley depicts the latter as thoroughly defeated – the “trunkless” legs stand without purpose while 
the head, as if decapitation is not humiliation enough, lies “shattered” and “half sunk” in the sand. In 
contrast, by explicitly mentioning that the statue’s visage is “half sunk” in the “sand,” Shelley implies 
that the desert itself is slowly consuming the statue and must therefore be the victor.
There are few wasted words here, and the meaning is immediately and efficiently clear.
