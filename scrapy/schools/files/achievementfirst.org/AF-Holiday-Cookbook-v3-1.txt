Tamales

What is a tamal? 

It’s a traditional Mexican dish that’s 
typically made around the holidays. The 
steamed dough can be filled with veggies, 
beans, or meat. Gabriela loves making 
these tamales de pollo because she gets to 
cook alongside her sous-chefs (her kiddos 
and AF scholars), Benjamin and Gabriel. 
Buen provecho! 

RECIPE BY GABRIELA, A PARENT AT AF NORTH BROOKLYN PREP ELEMENTARY 

6. Now it’s time to make the 
dough! Add the corn flour, 
chicken broth, salt to the 
oil. Mix the dough until the 
flour dissolves and has no 
lumps. Taste the dough to 
figure out if you need more 
salt. If it’s good to go, let 
it sit for about 10 minutes. 
(Note: If the dough is too 
dry, add more warm water)

7. You can now begin to 
stuff your tamales. Grab 
a corn husk, add 2 soup 
spoons of the dough 
mixture, add 11/2 soup 
spoons of sauce, and add 
as much chicken as you’d 
like. 

8. Once you’re done, put 
your tamales in a steamer. 
Make sure the steamer is 
covered well! Steam for 2 
hours with water. 

WHAT YOU NEED

Serving: 65 tamales
•  4  pounds corn flour
•  1  pound corn husks
•  ¼ pound guajillo chile
•  ¼ pound pulla chile
•  1  pound tomatoes 
•  ¼ pound cumin
•  3  pounds chicken breast 
•  3  cups vegetable or  

corn oil

lnstead of chicken, 
you can use pork.
Vegetable and corn
oil can also be 
substituted for 

pork lard.

INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a pot, bring the 
chicken to a boil in water 
(4 liters) with salt, ¼ onion, 
and two cloves of garlic. 
Boil for 1 hour. 

2. Wash the corn husks 
very well in warm water and 
drain them in a colander. 

3. For the sauce, remove 
the seeds from the dried 
guajillo and pulla chiles and 
cut them in half. Wash them 
and bring them to a boil in 
a pot for 8 minutes. When 
ready, put them in the 
blender with a little water, 
tomatoes, cumin, and salt. 

4. The chicken breasts 
should be ready. Take 
them out and let them dry 
for 15 minutes. Save the 
chicken broth (remove 
onion and garlic) and shred 
the chicken.

5. Set aside the oil in a pan 
and heat.

Pernil

(pork shoulder)

   Photo credit: www.saveur.com

This authentic Puerto Rican dish is a crowd favorite at AF Bushwick Elementary. To 
complete the meal, serve this with a side of arroz con gandules, potato salad, tostones, 
and sliced avocado. Now that’s a mouth-watering meal you have to try.

RECIPE BY ANA MARIA PETTAWAY, A SOCIAL WORKER AT AF BUSHWICK ELEMENTARY

INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a small food processor or blender, combine 
the garlic, dried oregano, black pepper, cumin, 
salt. Set the marinade “mojo” aside for the pork.

2. Next, cut the fat cap almost off the pork by 
leaving it hanging like the photos below. If you 
have fat left on the skin after cutting the skin 
off, that’s totally fine and typically ideal. This will 
help keep the meat juicy when roasting. Then, 
using a paring knife, cut small slits all over the 
meat without cutting into the skin. Clean the pork 
shoulder by running cold water over it in a large 
bowl. In the same bowl pour some apple cider 
vinegar into the bowl and let the pork should sit 
in the water and vinegar mixture for about 30 
minutes. After 30 minutes rinse off the vinegar 
off the pork shoulder with cold running water. 
Pat the shoulder with paper towels to take off 
excess liquid.

3. Take the mojo and spoon it into the slits and 
rub all over the pork.

4. Once the mojo is added to the pork make
sure everything is fully mixed and place the fat 
cap back over the pork like normal. Refrigerate 
the pork overnight. When ready to roast the next 
day, preheat your oven to 350ºF and take the
pork out of the fridge of the fridge.

WHAT YOU NEED

•  6-8 pound Boston butt (aka pork shoulder), 
     bone in and with fat cap left on
•  2 heads garlic, cloves peeled (crush about
     ½ of the cloves and leave the rest of the
     cloves whole)

5. Let it sit for about 30 minutes to get some of 
the chill off and then roast. Here is where you’re 
going to leave things alone. Depending on the 
weight of the pork, roast for 30-45 minutes per 
pound.

6. After the 3 hour mark, check the pork’s internal 
temperature. Once it’s at 180°F, the pork is 
finished. The skin should be a beautiful, golden 
color at this point but you’re going to want to 
crisp it up. Crank the heat up on the oven to 
450°F and crisp the skin for the pork. This will be 
to your liking and normally takes 10-15 minutes, 
but my favorite way to test out the skin is by 
knocking on it. If it sounds like you’re knocking 
on a tiny door, the pork skin “cuerito” is ready. It 
should be super crisp on the outside and tender 
underneath from the layer of fat.

7. Let the meat rest for about 20 minutes before 
carving or pulling. Remove the cuerito completely 
and then serve up the meat. Cut the cuerito up 
into small pieces so each person gets some skin 
on their plate for dinner. Serve the pernil with 
arroz con gandules, potato salad, tostones, and 
sliced avocado for an authentic Puerto Rican 
Christmas dinner.

•  2 tbsp dried oregano
•  1 tbsp black pepper
•  1 & ½ tbsp salt
•  1tsp cumin
•  ½ cup sofrito (use homemade for 
     a better and fresher taste!)

EASY chocolatechip 
cookies

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 350ºF.

2. Beat together the butter and sugar until 
completely combined and fluffy.

3. Add the egg and vanilla (if using) and mix 
until incorporated.

4. Stir in the flour (make sure your flour has not 
been packed down into the measuring cup 
when measured or there will be too much flour 
in your cookies), and the chocolate chips just 
until combined. Do not mix for a long time after 
adding the flour, it will create cookies that are 
too tough or cakey. Scoop into mounds about 2 
TBSP each onto ungreased cookie sheets (you 
can use a silpat or parchment paper to line your 
sheets if you want).

5. Bake at 350ºF until just set on the edges and
middle still looks a little bit undercooked. About 
8-12 minutes. (these cookies do not brown as 
much as other cookies because of the lack of 
baking soda or baking powder.)

6. Allow to cool on the baking sheets for 5 
minutes before removing. Cookies will continue 
to cook on the sheets for a few minutes.
