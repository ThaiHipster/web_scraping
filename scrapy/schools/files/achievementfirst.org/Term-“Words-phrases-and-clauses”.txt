Term: “Words, phrases, and clauses”

Deﬁnition:
In addition to words and phrases being used as transitions, the scholar also includes dependent clauses to
clarify the relationship between the claims and evidence. While participles and gerunds are phrases and not
clauses, scholars using these to join ideas are more characteristic of this level than of merely using
prepositional phrases as transitions.
