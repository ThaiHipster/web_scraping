Term: “Awkward or stilted transitions”

Deﬁnition:
Awkward or stilted transitions are transitions that disrupt the ﬂuency of the sentence and do not convey the
precise intended meaning. Awkward or stilted transitions also feel forced or robotic and do not ﬂow well
within the paragraph or sentence; they even detract the reader from the author’s message versus enhance it.
