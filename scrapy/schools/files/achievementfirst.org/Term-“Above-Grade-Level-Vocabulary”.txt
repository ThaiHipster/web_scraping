Term: “Above-Grade Level Vocabulary”

Deﬁnition:
These are words that are atypical for scholars at that age to use correctly and independently. For seventh and
eighth graders, these should be SAT style words, but for 5th and 6th graders, these words could be more
typical of an eighth graders’ vocabulary. To score a 7 or 8 on this criterion, scholars must include some above
grade level words; scholars only using grade level words cannot score higher than a 6, even if they are all
spelled correctly.
