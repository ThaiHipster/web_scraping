Conventions 2 (Set 2)

Analysis: Lit - Paired Passage
Conventions: Spelling

This paper scores a 2 for spelling due to the words beginning and perspective, both stated in the prompt, being consistently misspelled.
The scholar would have needed almost all words from the prompt spelled correctly to score higher.
Conventions: Grammar

This scholar scores a 2 for conventions because of the numerous errors in commas in compound sentences. For example, the sentence,
“Luke’s scared and he’s underage for war,” needed a comma before “and”. While one Luke isn’t capitalized, almost all of them are.
Therefore, this paper meets the criteria for a two but not a three.
