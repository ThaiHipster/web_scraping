Term: “Momentum of Writing”

Deﬁnition:
The energy of the writing is increased by the strategic use of evidence selection and the chunking of that
evidence and the crafting of blends to strategically maximize every word. While this trait is also tied to
concision, through the effective selection and presentation of evidence, the writing builds momentum and
energy.
