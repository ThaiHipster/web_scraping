Term: “Key words”
Definition: Key words are words or small phrases from a piece of evidence that are zoomed in on and 
incorporated into the interpretation of the evidence. Key words build toward literary analysis.

Example

The dark imagery makes an “artificial night”, deepening Romeo’s distance from the “light”. He tries to 
keep his love “private”, as Lord Montague says, and tries to keep any “light” or happiness out of his heart.

Gatsby is a target. Wolfsheim “made him” infers that if it were not for him, Gatsby would not be where 
he is. Before Gatsby meets Wolfsheim, he is an upstanding man “covered with medals”, but Wolfsheim 
corrupts him.

In spite of this, Odysseus accused Circe of “cramping his style” and “donned” his supposedly “heroic 
armor,” ready to kill Scylla.
