Deﬁnition:
Quotations are grammatically incorporated into other sentences. This could include the use of brackets to
clarify a pronoun, brackets around a verb in a different tense, or a blend that provides the grammatical set up
for the quote. This list is not exhaustive of possibilities. When these grammatical alterations are made,
however, the meaning of the quote should be preserved in full.
