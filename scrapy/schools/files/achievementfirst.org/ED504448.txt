eXecUTive sUMMAR y:
Moving Beyond Access: College Success for Low-Income, First-Generation Students

Why doeS coLLege SucceSS matter?

With major strides in access to postsecondary education for all students in 

recent decades, it is tempting to assume that such progress has erased 
disparities in college enrollment and completion in the United States. Yet 

despite having one of the highest college participation rates in the world, large gaps 
persist in terms of access to and success in higher education in this country, particu-
larly for low-income, minority, and first-generation students. 

Given the pressure to remain competitive in the global knowledge economy, it is in 
our shared national interest to act now to increase the number of students who not 
only enter college, but more importantly earn their degrees, particularly bachelor’s 
degrees. Due to the changing demographics of the United States, we must focus our 
efforts on improving postsecondary access and success among those populations who 
have previously been underrepresented in higher education, namely low-income and 
minority students, many of whom will be the first in their families to go to college.

In order to inform the efforts of educators and policymakers to improve college 
access and success, the Pell Institute has produced a report, funded by the 3M 
Foundation, that examines the current status of low-income, first-generation college 
students1 in higher education. Using data from the U.S. Department of Educa-
tion datasets, we describe the ways in which this population participates in higher 
education, including persistence and degree attainment rates, and compare their 
participation to other students, including those who are neither low-income nor 
first-generation. We discuss the barriers that low-income, first-generation students 
face to achieving success in college, as well as the strategies that colleges and 
universities can pursue to address these barriers and improve students’ chances of 
earning degrees. We also offer recommendations for institutional and government 
actions that could go a long way towards closing the access and success gaps that 
exist today for this doubly-disadvantaged population.

Low-income status is defined as having a family income below $25,000 and first-generation status includes students whose parents do 
not have bachelor’s degrees. Here we focus our comparisons between low-income, first-generation students and students who are neither 
low-income nor first-generation.

hoW do LoW-income, FirSt-generation StudentS 
Fare in coLLege?

For most of the 4.5 million low-income, first-generation students enrolled in post-
secondary education today (approximately 24 percent of the undergraduate popu-
lation), the path to the bachelor’s degree will be long, indirect, and uncertain. For 
many, the journey will end where it begins. Using data from the National Center for 
Education Statistics’ Beginning Postsecondary Study (BPS:96/01), we found that 
low-income, first-generation students experience less success than their peers right 
from the start. Across all institution types:

•	

•	

Low-income, first-generation students were nearly four times more likely – 26 to 7 
percent - to leave higher education after the first year than students who had neither 
of these risk factors. 

Six years later, nearly half (43 percent) of low-income, first-generation students had 
left college without earning their degrees. Among those who left, nearly two-thirds 
(60 percent) did so after the first year. 

After six years, only 11 percent of low-income, first-generation students had earned 
bachelor’s degrees compared to 55 percent of their more advantaged peers. This was 
due in part to lower graduation rates for low-income, first-generation students in 
the four-year sector:

•	

•	

In public four-year institutions, only 34 percent of low-income, first-generation stu-
dents earned bachelor’s degrees in six years compared to 66 percent of their peers. 

In private, not-for-profit four-year institutions, there was an even larger gap between 
low-income, first-generation students and their peers, 43 to 80 percent respectively.

Despite such gaps, low-income, first-generation students were actually more than 
seven times more likely to earn bachelor’s degrees if they started in four-year insti-
tutions, but only 25 percent of them did so. A large number of low-income, first-gen-
eration students began - and ended - their studies at public two-year and for-profit 
institutions. 

More advantaged students who began at public two-year institutions went on to 
attain bachelor’s degrees at nearly five times the rate of low-income, first-generation 
students, 24 versus 5 percent respectively. This is due largely to higher transfer 
rates among students who were neither low-income nor first-generation; only 14 
percent of low-income, first-generation students attending public two-year and for-
profit institutions transferred to four-year institutions within six years compared to 
50 percent of their more advantaged peers. 

It is worth noting that not all students who attend public two-year and for-profit 
institutions enroll with the intention of earning bachelor’s degrees. Many of these 
students plan to and successfully complete certificates and associate’s degrees. How-
ever, we found that 63 percent of low-income, first-generation students attending 
public two-year institutions said they planned to earn at least a bachelor’s degree, 
with nearly half of these students aspiring to post-baccalaureate degrees. Yet, only 5 
percent of them actually earned bachelor’s degrees within six years. 

Thus, we see that while public two-year and for-profit institutions are major 
points of initial access to postsecondary education for low-income, first-generation 
students, and provide a reasonable opportunity to earn certificates or associate’s 
degrees, the chances of successfully attaining the increasingly important baccalau-
reate degree via these institutions are limited for this population.  

What are the conStraintS on coLLege SucceSS
For LoW -income, FirSt-generation StudentS?

   

Our analysis shows low-income, first-generation students face a number of challeng-
es that make it difficult for them to be successful in college. They disproportionately 
come from ethnic and racial minority backgrounds with lower levels of academic 
preparation. They also tend to be older, less likely to receive financial support from 
parents, and more likely to have multiple obligations outside college, like family 
and work, that limit their full participation in the college experience. Research has 
shown that these factors lower students’ chances of persisting to graduation.

Previous research has also shown, however, that even after taking their demograph-
ic backgrounds, enrollment characteristics, and academic preparation into consider-
ation, low-income and first-generation students are still at greater risk of failure in 
postsecondary education. This suggests that the problem is as much the result of the 
experiences these students have during college as it is attributable to the experi-
ences they have before they enroll.

Research has shown that low-income and first-generation students are less likely 
to be engaged in the academic and social experiences that foster success in college, 
such as studying in groups, interacting with faculty and other students, participat-
ing in extracurricular activities, and using support services. Lower levels of academ-
ic and social integration among this population are inextricably linked to finances 
and financial aid. 

Due largely to a lack of resources, low-income, first-generation students are more 
likely to live and work off-campus and to take classes part-time while working full-
time, which limits the amount of time they spend on campus. As our research using 
data from NCES’ National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:04 UG) shows, 
unmet financial need – need that remains after applying all financial aid – is a ma-
jor problem for low-income, first-generation students. The mean amount of unmet 
need for low-income, first-generation students is nearly $6,000 (before loans), which 
represents half of their median annual income of $12,100. As a result, they work 
and borrow more with negative consequences in terms of college completion.

hoW can We Promote coLLege acceSS and SucceSS 
For LoW -income, FirSt-generation StudentS?

For too many low-income, first-generation students, the newly-opened door to Amer-
ican higher education has been a revolving one. The unavoidable fact is that while 
college access has increased for this population, the opportunity to successfully earn 
a college degree, especially the bachelor’s degree, has not. The major barrier to the 
baccalaureate for low-income, first-generation students is that vast majority of them 
begin – and end – their studies in two-year and for-profit institutions. Unfortunate-
ly, the segregation of low-income students into the less-than-four-year sector has 
only gotten worse over time. 

What can be done to increase the number of low-income, first-generation students 
who enroll in and graduate from four-year institutions with bachelor’s degrees? We 
offer the following recommendations to practitioners and policymakers alike:

Improve academic preparation for college: Taking a rigorous high school 
curriculum, including advanced mathematics, greatly increases the chances that 
low-income and first-generation students will attend college, particularly four-year 
institutions. To that end, students and their parents need: 

•	

More information and counseling about gateway courses before high school. 

•	

Support to complete challenging coursework given gaps in prior preparation. 

•	

Greater access to rigorous college-preparatory courses with well-prepared teachers. 

•	

A strong college-going culture in their high schools with adequate support  
from well-trained counselors.

E x e c u t i v e   S u m m a r y

Encourage engagement on the college campus: Colleges must remove the bar-
riers (primarily financial) that prevent low-income, first-generation students from 
fully engaging in the experiences associated with success by: 

•	

•	

•	

Exposing students to the college environment as early as possible through  
college tours and other college planning exercises. 

Offering additional opportunities for work-study to increase the amount of  
time these students spend on campus while meeting their financial needs. 

Focusing on increasing interaction and engagement in the classroom to  
make use of the only time many of these students spend on campus.

Promote (re)entry for young and working adults: In order to meet economic 
competitiveness needs, most states will need to help young and working adults get 
back on the college track by:

•	

Providing support programs to help adults complete their GED.

•	

Offering college credit for experiential learning in the workplace.

•	

•	

Reaching out to students who leave college with a limited number of  
credits remaining to graduation. 

Expanding financial aid eligibility for part-time students and/or providing  
additional resources (e.g. childcare) to promote persistence.

As the United States continues to realize the importance of increasing the educa-
tional attainment of its citizens as the key to its future economic stability in the 
global marketplace, improving postsecondary access and success among underrepre-
sented populations, such as low-income, first-generation students, is paramount. As 
the analysis in this report has shown, there is much work to be done if this growing 
population is to participate and achieve within higher education similar to their 
more advantaged peers. Without action by policymakers at all levels, it appears that 
not only will these students be left behind, but so too will the United States.

Provide additional financial aid for college: With adequate resources, more 
low-income, first-generation students could afford to enroll in four-year institutions 
or attend full-time, both of which would increase their chances of earning four-
year degrees. Unfortunately, funding for the Federal Pell Grant and Work-Study 
programs has not kept pace while tuition and fees have increased dramatically in 
recent years. To reduce the impact of financial barriers, low-income, first-generation 
students need:

•	

•	

•	

•	

Outreach through workshops for students and their parents about the  
financial aid process, especially filling out the FAFSA. 

Improved financial literacy about their options for covering the cost of  
attendance at four-year institutions, including the prudent use of loans. 

Increases in grant aid from institutional, state, and federal sources, which will  
require a shift away from merit aid at the institutional and state levels. 

Greater assistance with covering unmet financial need, such as through  
the use of expanded work-study programs. 

Increase transfer rates to four-year colleges: Given the economic and other 
realities that force most low-income, first-generation students to begin their studies 
in the two-year sector, there needs to be a greater emphasis on increasing transfer 
rates from two- to four-year colleges by providing: 

•	

A clear vision of the long-term pathway from high school to a two-year college  
and then to a four-year college through pre-college counseling. 

•	

Effective developmental courses to address shortcomings in preparation. 

•	

Strong transfer counseling from advisors as well as favorable articulation policies. 

•	

Adequate financial counseling and aid (e.g. transfer scholarships) as well as  
academic and social support to ensure degree completion after transfer.

Ease the transition to college: Low-income, first-generation students need con-
siderable support as they make the transition to college. Strategies that have been 
shown to help include:

•	

Early intervention through bridge and orientation programs. 

•	

Advising, tutoring, and mentoring by faculty and peers. 

•	

Participation in special programs for at-risk populations that “scale down”  
the college experience.

M o v i n g   B e y o n d   A c c e s s

On the surface, America’s public commitment to provide access to any indi-

vidual who seeks a postsecondary education seems to be gaining ground. The 
United States’ higher education system has one of the highest participation 
rates in the world (OECD, 2007). Nearly 15 million students are currently enrolled 
as undergraduates in U.S. colleges and universities, a number that has more than 
doubled in the past 35 years (NCES, 2007a). As overall enrollments have grown, 
the number of students from historically underrepresented groups participating in 
higher education, including low-income and first-generation college students, has 
also risen. For example, the number of low-income students entering college imme-
diately after high school has increased by over 60 percent since 1970, with nearly 
1.6 million enrolling for the first time in 2005 (Mortenson, 2007). Today, it might 
seem that access to higher education for all students, including those from low-
income and other disadvantaged backgrounds, is greater than ever. 

But scratch the surface of this apparent success, and the story about access and 
opportunity in American higher education is much more complex and a lot less 
hopeful. Although there have been improvements in terms of access, equality in the 
attainment of four-year college degrees remains elusive for low-income and first-
generation students. The baccalaureate degree attainment rate among young people 
from low-income families increased from 6 percent in 1970 to 12 percent in 2005; 
however, the rate among high-income youth increased from 40 percent to 73 percent 
(Mortenson, 2007). This means that high-income youth are six times more likely to 
earn a four-year degree than are low-income students, and the gap between them 
has nearly doubled in the last 35 years. 

This disparity in degree attainment reflects the fact that, despite recent gains in 
access, low-income and first-generation students are still less likely to go to college 
than their more privileged peers. While the college continuation rate (the percent-
age of high school seniors who go on to college immediately) for low-income high 
school graduates doubled from 26 percent in 1972 to 54 percent in 2005, it still lags 
considerably behind the 81 percent rate for high-income students (NCES, 2007b). 
However, the disparity in baccalaureate degree attainment also reflects a persistent 
and growing gap in degree completion among those who do go to college (Mortenson, 
2007). As these data illustrate, it is no longer enough to be concerned only about 
whether low-income and first-generation students go to college. We also must be 
concerned about where and how they go to college – and the experiences they have 
once enrolled – to ensure that this population can stay there through the completion 
of a degree, particularly the bachelor’s degree.

Why College Retention Matters

Why does degree attainment matter? The consequences of this continuing loss of 
human capital cannot be underestimated. For example, the difference between a 
high school diploma and a four-year degree in both annual and lifetime earnings 
is considerable, and the gap has increased significantly over time (U.S. Census 
Bureau, 2002). Today’s four-year college graduates will earn nearly $1 million more 
over their working lives than will those who only receive a high school diploma and 
nearly $500,000 more than those who attend some college and/or earn a two-year 
degree (College Board, 2007). For the vast majority of low-income individuals, earn-
ing a bachelor’s degree is the only way they can increase their earning potential 
enough to overcome their current economic circumstances (Terenzini et al, 2001). In-
creasing the number of bachelor’s degree recipients pays big dividends for society as 
well, providing much needed tax revenue for states and the nation at large. It also 
reduces the range of costs the nation now bears for poverty, unemployment, crime, 
and health, all of which are associated with lower levels of education and income 
(College Board, 2007; IHEP, 2005). 

Furthermore, it has become all too apparent that our nation must improve the 
educational attainment rates of its citizens in order to increase our competitive-
ness in the global knowledge economy. Over the next ten years, 80 percent of the 
fastest-growing occupations in the U.S. will require at least an associate’s degree; 50 
percent will require a bachelor’s degree or higher (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2005). 
After leading the world in degree production for decades, overall degree attainment 
rates have stagnated in the United States while other countries have made rapid 
gains in recent years. The problem is that while the United States continues to have 
one of the highest college participation rates in the world (although ground has been 
lost here too), the nation ranks in the bottom half in terms of degree completion, 
and ties for last in baccalaureate degree completion (NCPPHE, 2006; OECD, 2007; 
Reindl, 2007). Simply put, it is in our shared national interest to act now to increase 
the number of students who not only enter college, but more importantly earn their 
degrees, particularly baccalaureates.

Yet, due to rapidly changing demographics, the overall educational attainment of 
the United States is actually expected to decline in the coming years (Kelly, 2005). 
The fastest growing segments of the population, low-income and minority youth, 
have historically been the least likely to earn college degrees, and the gaps in degree 
attainment for these groups have only increased over time (Kelly, 2005; Mortenson, 
March 2006; WICHE, 2003). Today, there are more than 12 million children living in 
poverty, two-thirds of whom come from minority backgrounds (U.S. Census Bureau, 
2003). Nearly half of all school children (44 percent), the future college-going popu-
lation, come from low-income families (as measured by free/reduced price lunch eli-
gibility). This number has been on the rise for the last ten years (Mortenson, March 

I n t r o d u c t i o n

2006). Thus, in order to increase degree attainment rates in this country, there 
must be a major effort to improve both postsecondary access and success among 
those populations who have previously been underrepresented in higher education, 
namely low-income and minority students, many of whom will be the first in their 
families to go to college.

This report examines the postsecondary characteristics, experiences, and outcomes 
of low-income, first-generation college students. Previous research has separately 
examined how low-income status (see Choy, 2000; Cook & King, 2004) and first-
generation status (see Chen, 2005; Nunez & Cuccaro-Alamin, 1998) correlate with a 
range of factors (i.e. demographic and enrollment characteristics) that lower these 
students’ chances of successfully earning a college degree. In this report, we aim to 
show how the combined impact of these two characteristics put students who are 
both low-income and the first in their families to go to college at the greatest risk 
of failure in postsecondary education. By focusing on low-income, first-generation 
students, we hope to increase the amount of attention – and resources – given to 
improving college success for this doubly-disadvantaged population.

Using data from the U.S. Department of Education datasets, we describe the ways 
in which this population participates in higher education, including persistence and 
degree attainment rates, and compare their participation to other students, includ-
ing those who are neither low-income nor first-generation. We discuss the barriers 
that low-income, first-generation students face to achieving success in college, as 
well as the strategies that colleges and universities can pursue to address these 
barriers and improve these students’ chances of earning degrees. Finally, we offer 
recommendations for institutional and government actions that could go a long way 
towards closing the access and success gaps that exist today.

ABoUT THe dATA

The data presented in this report are drawn from three datasets from the U.S. Department 
of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES):

National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) 
NPSAS examines how students and their families pay for postsecondary education. The 
study is based on a nationally representative sample of students in postsecondary education 
institutions, including undergraduate, graduate, and first-professional students. Students 
attending all types and levels of institutions are represented, including public and private 
not-for-profit and for-profit institutions at the less-than-two-year, two-year, and four-year 
levels. NPSAS includes general demographics and other characteristics of these students, 
types of aid and amounts received, cost of attending college, combinations of work, study, 
and borrowing, and enrollment patterns. The data in this report come from the most 
recent undergraduate NPSAS (NPSAS:04) which was conducted during the 2003-2004 
academic year.

Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) Study
BPS is a longitudinal study that follows students who enrolled in a postsecondary institution 
for the first time. A sample of students is surveyed during their first year, and three and  
six years later, about their undergraduate experiences, persistence in school, transfer 
between institutions, degree completion, and employment following enrollment. The data 
in this report come from the most recently completed BPS, which follows students who 
first enrolled in postsecondary education in 1995-1996 over a six-year period to 2001-
2002. The BPS:96/01 sample was drawn from first-time undergraduates participating in the 
NPSAS:96 study. 

Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) Study
B&B is a longitudinal study that follows students who have completed their baccalaureate 
degrees. The data in this report come from the first complete B&B study, which includes 
about 11,000 students who were identified in the NPSAS:93 study as having earned their 
bachelor’s degrees in the 1992-93 academic year. These students were surveyed in their last 
year of undergraduate studies and followed up one (1994), four (1997), and ten (2003) 
years later. Students were asked questions about their undergraduate education and their 
educational and employment experiences after graduation.

The Federal TRIO Programs

-geneRATion sTUdenTs:

An additional reason for choosing low-income, first-generation students as the focus of 
this report is that this population is frequently the target audience for many pre-college and 
in-college support programs. The federally-funded TRIO programs are among the largest 
and oldest of such programs that provide services directly to this student population. The 
TRIO programs form a continuum of support for low-income, first-generation, and disabled 
students that extends from middle school through college. As defined in the Higher Educa-
tion Act – the legislation that addresses the majority of the federal government’s invest-
ment in higher education – two-thirds of participants in TRIO programs must be both 
low-income and first-generation; the rest may be either low-income or first-generation. 
Nationwide, more than 2,800 TRIO programs serve nearly one million students annually.
The talent Search and upward Bound programs provide pre-college services that aim 
to increase college awareness and preparation among middle- and high-school students. 
Both programs offer counseling, tutoring, mentoring, and workshops to provide students 
with information about the college admissions process as well as to provide assistance 
with obtaining financial aid (e.g. help with filling out the FAFSA) and preparing for college 
entrance exams. Upward Bound offers a more intensive program that includes supplemen-
tal academic instruction in key college-preparatory courses after school and on Saturdays 
throughout the school year and during a summer program usually held on a college 
campus. Another program, upward Bound math/Science, helps high school students 
recognize and develop their potential to excel in math and science and encourages them to 
pursue postsecondary degrees and careers in these fields.

The educational opportunity centers help adults (over age 19) get back on the college 
track. The program assists participants by helping them earn their high school equivalency 
degrees, apply to college and secure financial aid, re-enter college, and/or successfully 
remain enrolled in college until graduation. The veterans upward Bound program assists 
adults who have served in the military by helping them transition to postsecondary educa-
tion. 
The Student Support Services program serves students who are enrolled in two- and 
four-year institutions. The program provides services aimed at improving college persis-
tence and graduation rates among this population as well as increasing transfer rates from 
two- to four-year institutions. Services include instruction in basic skills, tutoring, academic 
advising, financial aid and career counseling, transfer and graduate school counseling, and 
mentoring. Some programs also provide grant aid to participants.
The ronald e. mcnair Post-Baccalaureate achievement Program aims to increase 
the number of doctoral degrees earned by students from disadvantaged populations 
(low-income, first-generation, and underrepresented minority students) who have strong 
academic potential by providing assistance with graduate school preparation, application, 
and entrance.2

In order to understand the population of students who are the focus of this 

report, it is first important to understand how this group is being defined here. 
For purposes of our analysis, low-income status is defined as having a household 
annual income under $25,000.3 First-generation status is defined by neither parent 
having earned a bachelor’s degree.4 Low-income, first-generation students meet both 
of these criteria. 

There are currently more than 4.5 million low-income, first-generation students 
enrolled in postsecondary institutions – approximately 24 percent of the overall un-
dergraduate population. Using data from the U.S. Department of Education’s 2003-
2004 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), a profile of risk emerges 
among this population relative to their peers5 in higher education. 

Demographically, low-income, first-generation students are more likely than their 
most advantaged peers to:

•	

be 

older;

•	

be 

female; 

•	

have a 

disability;

•	

come from 

minority backgrounds;

•	

be 

non-native english speakers and to have been born outside of the u.S.;

•	

have 

dependent children and to be single parents;

•	

have earned a

 high school equivalency diploma; and

•	

be 

financially independent from their parents.

In this study, low-income status was defined as a family income below $25,000 because this is approximately the cut-off at which students 
lose eligibility for the Federal Pell Grant and TRIO programs. For example, 96 percent of students (independent and dependent) receiving 
the maximum Pell Grant award have family incomes under $30,000; 79 percent have family incomes below $20,000 (U.S. Department of 
Education, 2008). In other studies, the low-income threshold for independent students is often defined as $10,000; however, 43 percent of 
independent students receiving the maximum Pell Grant award have incomes between $9,000 and $30,000. The median income of all Pell 
Grant recipients (independent and dependent) is $17,217, a number that has not changed significantly in real terms since the inception of 
the program (Cook & King, 2007). 
In this study, first-generation status includes students whose parents may have some college, postsecondary certificates, or associate’s 
degrees, but not bachelor’s degrees. This is the definition of first-generation status used by the Federal TRIO programs. Other studies have 
defined first-generation students as those whose parents have no education beyond high school (see Chen, 2005; Horn & Nunez, 2000; 
Nunez & Cuccaro-Alamin, 1998; Warburton, Bugarin, & Nunez, 2001). Regardless of how first-generation status is defined, research has 
found significant differences between students whose parents have bachelor’s degrees or higher and students whose parents have some 
or no college experience (Bui, 2002; Lee, Sax, Kim, & Hagedorn, 2004).  
The data in this section were generated from the NPSAS:04 study using the Data Analysis System (DAS) online. In our analysis we 
compared three groups of students: (1) students who were low-income (under $25K) and first-generation (neither parent has a BA), 
(2) students who were low-income only or first-generation only, and (3) students who were neither low-income (above $25K) nor first-
generation (at least one parent has a BA). The data reported here do not separate dependent and independent students, which is the 
norm in research on first-generation college students (see Chen, 2005; Nunez & Cuccaro-Alamin, 1998). Also, the TRIO programs do 
not use dependency status for determining eligibility nor for reporting outcome data; a purpose of this report is to provide nationally 
comparative data for TRIO educators.

Low-income, first-generation college students are also more likely than their most 
advantaged peers to:

•	

delay entry

 into postsecondary education after high school;

•	

attend college 

closer to home;

•	

live off-campus;

•	

attend 

part-time; and

•	

work

 full-time while enrolled.

Previous research has shown that these demographic and enrollment characteristics 
are risk factors that are independently associated with lower rates of degree attain-
ment, they are interrelated, and they intersect with low-income and first-generation 
status to reduce the chances of earning a college degree, especially the bachelor’s 
degree (see Chen, 2005; Choy, 2000; Nunez & Cuccaro-Alamin, 1998).

RisK F AcToRs FoR A TTRiTion FRoM PosTsecondAR y edUcATion

Studies conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics have identified 
seven factors that put students at risk of leaving postsecondary education without 
earning their degrees (see Horn & Premo, 1995; Horn, 1996; Berkner et al, 1996, 
2003). These include:

•	

Delaying entry into postsecondary education after high school.

The more risk factors a student has, the more likely it is that student will fail 
to earn a bachelor’s degree. Students with no risk factors who entered four-year 
institutions in 1995-1996, for instance, were more than three times as likely to earn 
a bachelor’s degree by 2001 than students with two or more risk factors, 62 to 19 
percent respectively (Berkner et al, 2003).

•	

Attending part-time.

•	

Working full-time while enrolled.

•	

Being financially independent from parents.

•	

Having dependent children.

•	

Being a single parent.

•	

Having a GED.

The risk factors are often interrelated: many students who have one risk factor (e.g. 
enroll part-time) tend to have other risk factors as well (e.g. work full-time). Delay-
ing entry into postsecondary education and attending part-time have the greatest 
impact on student attrition. The risk factors are also often correlated with students’ 
background characteristics. Minority students, students from low-income families, 
students who are the first in their family to go to college, and other “nontraditional” 
students tend to have more risk factors than their peers (see Horn & Premo, 1995; 
Horn, 1996; Berkner et al, 1996, 2003). 

Students enrolled in two-year institutions are also much more likely to have one or 
more risk factors than students attending four-year institutions. For example, 86 
percent of students who began their studies at four-year institutions in 1995-1996 
had no risk factors compared to 25 percent of students who started at public two-
year institutions Conversely, 75 percent of students who started at public two-year 
institutions had one or more risk factors, while only 14 percent of students at four-
year institutions did (Berkner et al, 2003). 

On average, low-income, first-generation students attending postsecondary institu-
tions in 2003-2004 had three risk factors. Only 14 percent of low-income, first-gener-
ation students had no risk factors compared to 50 percent of their most advantaged 
peers. Clearly, low-income, first-generation students enter postsecondary education 
with a number of challenges that put them at risk for not earning their degrees.

Low-income, first-generation students differ from students who do not have any of 
these risk factors not only in terms of how they enroll in postsecondary education, 
but where. The majority of low-income first-generation undergraduates, 75 percent, 
begin their studies at two-year and for-profit institutions. As a result, they tend to 
be underrepresented in public and private four-year institutions, where they make 
up 18 and 16 percent of the population respectively, and to be overrepresented in 
public two-year and for-profit institutions, where they make up 27 and 40 percent. 
By comparison, more than half of their most advantaged peers (54 percent) begin at 
four-year institutions, a fact that accounts for much of the gap between these groups 
in baccalaureate degree completion, as we will see in the analysis that follows.

Given the profile of low-income, first-generation students, it is not unexpected 

that they do not fare as well as their counterparts in college. Using data from 
the U.S. Department of Education’s Beginning Postsecondary Study (BPS) 

we examined the postsecondary experiences and outcomes of students who entered 
higher education in 1995-1996. As these data show, low-income, first-generation 
students experience less success than their peers6 right from the start. 

The first year of college is widely recognized as a crucial point for all students 
(Tinto, 1993), but the transition to college can be particularly difficult for at-risk 
populations. Across all institution types, low-income, first-generation students were 
nearly four times more likely – 26 to 7 percent – to leave higher education after the 
first year than students who had neither of these risk factors. Low-income, first-
generation students experienced the highest drop-out rates in the public two-year 
and for-profit sectors, but they were more likely to leave postsecondary education 
after the first year no matter where they began their studies. In fact, low-income, 
first-generation students who started in public, four-year institutions were three 
times more likely to leave after the first year compared to their most advantaged 
peers, 12 to 4 percent respectively. They were more than five times as likely to leave 
in the first year than their most advantaged peers in private, not-for-profit four-year 
institutions.

The data in this section were generated from the BPS:96/01 study using the DAS online. In our analysis we compared three groups of 
students: (1) students who were low-income (under $25K) and first-generation (neither parent has a BA), (2) students who were low-
income only or first-generation only, and (3) students who were neither low-income (above $25K) nor first-generation (at least one 
parent has a BA). The data reported here does not separate dependent and independent students, which is the norm in research on 
first-generation college students (see Chen, 2005; Nunez & Cuccaro-Alamin, 1998). Also, the TRIO programs do not use dependency status 
for determining eligibility nor for reporting outcome data; a purpose of this report is to provide nationally comparative data for TRIO 
educators.

1   Students who attain in the first year complete one-year certificate programs. Most frequently these students  

attend two-year or for-profit institutions, where most one-year certificate programs are offered, but some  
four-year institutions also offer these programs. Students who attain a certificate or degree in the first year  
are considered to have been retained to the second year even though they do not necessarily  
return since they remained enrolled through the completion of their program. 

Note: The data for other institution types, including private less-than-four year and public  

less-than-two-year institutions, are not included here due to small sample size.

After six years, nearly half (43 percent) of low-income, first-generation students had 
not attained degrees and had left postsecondary education altogether. Among those 
who left, nearly two-thirds (60 percent) did so after the first year.7 While this popu-
lation had the highest drop-out rates at public two-year and for-profit institutions, 
they still dropped out at more than twice the rate of their most advantaged peers at 
public four-year institutions and nearly three times their rate at private four-year 
institutions. 

Overall, 13 percent of low-income, first-generation students remained enrolled after 
six years, which was comparable to their most advantaged peers. A major differ-
ence was at four-year institutions where low-income, first-generation students were 
more likely to remain enrolled compared to their most advantaged peers. At private 
four-year institutions, for example, low-income, first-generation students were more 
than twice as likely (16 to 7 percent) to remain enrolled after six years. These data 
demonstrate that the path to the bachelor’s degree is a long one for a considerable 
number of low-income, first-generation students.

The path to the bachelor’s degree is also not a direct one for this population. Over-
all, the baccalaureate degree attainment rate for low-income, first-generation 
students after six years was only 11 percent compared to 55 percent for their most 
advantaged peers. This was due in part to low graduation rates among low-income, 
first-generation students in the four-year sector. The rate at which low-income, 
first-generation students earned bachelor’s degrees was more than 30 percent lower 
at public four-year institutions and more than 40 percent lower at private four-year 
institutions than for students who were neither low-income nor first-generation.

Low baccalaureate degree attainment rates were also due to the large number of 
low-income, first-generation students who began – and ended – their studies at pub-
lic two-year and for-profit institutions. The more advantaged students who began at 
public two-year institutions went on to attain bachelor’s degrees at nearly five times 
the rate of low-income, first-generation students, 24 to 5 percent respectively. This 
can be attributed to lower transfer rates for low-income, first-generation students. 
Among students who began their postsecondary education at public two-year or 
for-profit institutions, 74 percent of low-income, first-generation students did not 
transfer anywhere within six years compared to 38 percent of their most advan-
taged peers. Only 14 percent of low-income, first-generation students transferred to 
four-year institutions compared to 50 percent of their most advantaged peers within 
this time frame.

1  This table provides information on transfer rates for all students regardless of degree attainment. Therefore, students who 
did not transfer may (or may not) have attained a certificate or associate’s degree. Likewise, students who did transfer may 
(or may not) have attained prior to doing so.

It is worth noting that not all students who attend public two-year and for-profit 
institutions enroll with the intention of earning a bachelor’s degree. Many students 
plan to and successfully complete certificates and associate’s degrees in these sec-
tors. In fact, 30 percent of low-income, first-generation students earned certificates 
or associate’s degrees in the public two-year sector, and nearly 60 percent did so in 
the for-profit sector within six years. However, the majority of students who began 
their studies at these institutions said they wanted to earn a bachelor’s degree or 
higher at some point in their postsecondary careers, including 55 percent of low-
income, first-generation students. At public two-year institutions, 63 percent of low-
income, first-generation students planned to earn at least a bachelor’s degree, with 
nearly half of these students aspiring to post-baccalaureate degrees.

Yet, only 5 percent of low-income, first-generation students who began at public two-
year institutions actually earned bachelor’s degrees within six years. At for-profit 
institutions, less than 1 percent of low-income, first-generation students earned 
bachelor’s degrees within six years despite the fact that 35 percent of them as-
pired to do so upon entering postsecondary education. Clearly, there is a major gap 
between baccalaureate aspirations and attainment for low-income, first-generation 
students who begin their studies at public two-year and for-profit institutions.

Thus, while the public two-year and the for-profit institutions are major points of 
initial access to postsecondary education for low-income, first-generation students, 
and provide a reasonable opportunity to earn a certificate or associates degree, the 
chances of successfully attaining the increasingly important baccalaureate degree 
via these institutions are limited for this population.  

Student retention By major FieLd oF Study in 
Four-year inStitutionS

As our analyses have shown, starting at a four-year institution offers the best and 
most direct route to the bachelor’s degree for all students. However, there are still 
considerable gaps in baccalaureate attainment between low-income, first-generation 
students and their peers even at this level. In order to better understand the gaps 
that remain, we were interested in whether low-income, first-generation students 
attending four-year institutions were majoring in different fields than their peers, 
and as a result, experiencing different and disparate degree outcomes. We were also 
interested in whether low-income, first-generation students had an equal opportu-
nity to gain access to and experience success in all fields of study relative to their 
peers. Using data from the U.S. Department of Education’s Beginning Postsecondary 
Study (BPS), we examined which majors were chosen by undergraduates who began 
their studies in four-year institutions8 in 1995-1996 and whether or not students in 
these fields earned degrees by 2001, comparing low-income, first-generation stu-
dents with their peers.9

There were not considerable differences between low-income, first-generation stu-
dents and their peers in terms of the majors they declared during their first year of 
study. Low-income, first-generation students attending four-year institutions were 
slightly less likely than their peers to be undeclared majors. They were also some-
what less likely to major in the humanities. They were slightly more likely to major 
in the social sciences, business, health, as well as vocational, technical, and profes-
sional fields (hereafter referred to as vocational). They were as likely as their peers 
to major in education, mathematics and science, and computer science/engineering.

In order to ensure clarity in the interpretation of the results in this section, we limited the analyses to students who began their studies in 
public and private not-for-profit four-year institutions and only attended that institution. For reference, 62 percent of students who began 
in four-year institutions remained at that institution, which was the same for both low-income, first-generation students and their peers.
In order to simplify the analysis in this section, we only compare low-income, first-generation students to students who are neither low-
income nor first-generation.

There were some differences that emerged in terms of students’ major when last 
enrolled in undergraduate studies, however. Low-income, first-generation students 
were still less likely than their peers to major in the humanities; but, they were 
now also less likely to major in education, mathematics and science, and vocational 
fields. They were more likely than their peers to major in computer science, busi-
ness, and health and as likely to major in the social sciences and computer science/
engineering. These changes largely reflect students moving from undeclared to de-
clared majors, but some of the changes were also due to students switching majors.

There were some differences between low-income, first-generation students and 
their peers in terms of whether they remained in their major field from their first 
year to the last year they were enrolled. Low-income, first-generation students were 
less likely than their peers to remain in education, mathematics and science, and 
health. They were more likely than their peers to remain in the social sciences, com-
puter science/engineering, business, and vocational fields; they were about as likely 
to remain in the humanities.

Low-income, first-generation students were most likely to remain business majors 
at 86 percent and the least likely to remain majors in mathematics and science at

ation were most likely to remain in the social sciences at 72 percent and the least 
likely to remain in the humanities at 55 percent. The largest gap between low-in-
come, first-generation students and their peers in terms of being “retained” in their 
major was in mathematics and sciences, where they were 15 percent less likely than 
their peers to stay in their major.

Despite some differences with their peers in terms of their choice of major, however, 
low-income, first-generation students were more likely to get an associate’s degree 
(although not many do at this level), less likely to earn a bachelor’s degree, more 
likely to still be enrolled and more likely to have dropped out than their peers in 
every field of study.

Overall, 46 percent of low-income, first-generation students attending four-year in-
stitutions earned bachelor’s degrees within six years compared to 83 percent of their 
peers. Low-income, first-generation students had the lowest baccalaureate attain-
ment rate in health at 25 percent (where they also have the highest rate of earning 
associate’s degrees), and they had the highest dropout rate in the humanities, at 41 
percent. They had their highest rate of earning bachelor’s degrees in the social sci-
ences, 55 percent.

By comparison, students who were neither low-income nor first-generation had their 
highest baccalaureate attainment rate in mathematics and sciences with 91 percent 
and their lowest rate in vocational fields at 79 percent. 

The largest gap in baccalaureate degree attainment between low-income, first-
generation students and their peers was in the health fields at 51 percent; while the 
smallest gap was in the vocational fields at 26 percent. The gap was consistently 
around 35 percent in all other major fields.

In conclusion, while there were some differences between low-income, first-gener-
ation students and their peers attending four-year institutions in terms of which 
fields of study they chose to major in, the larger differences were related to which 
types of degrees they earned and whether they earned degrees at all. The same pat-
terns in degree attainment and attrition were evident in every field of study. 

For colleges and universities seeking to improve retention and graduation rates 
among this population, an institution-wide effort is clearly warranted as low-
income, first-generation students need additional support across the curriculum. 
However, it is also clear that low-income, first-generation students in some majors 
are earning degrees at higher rates than students from similar backgrounds in 
other major fields. Therefore, there may be some departmental or discipline-based 
strategies that could be replicated in other majors to improve the chances of success 
for this population. This is worthy of further study.

Although it is beyond the scope of the data available here, it is also worth study-
ing when in the major selection process low-income, first-generation students are 
most likely to leave postsecondary education. Do they leave prior to or after starting 
coursework in their major? Do they leave prior to selecting a major? Low-income, 
first-generation students were less likely than their peers to be undecided about 
their major during their first year, 30 to 33 percent; however, nearly half (42 per-
cent) of low-income, first-generation students who were undecided left postsecond-
ary education without earning their degrees compared to approximately one in ten 
of their undecided peers (11 percent). What types of support can be targeted to low-
income, first-generation students who are undecided to help them transition into a 
major field of study and to keep them on track through degree completion? 

Low-income, first-generation students greatly increase their chances of earning a 
bachelor’s degree if they start at a four-year institution; but they still need a great 
deal of help at both the institutional and departmental level to ensure that they 
have the same chances to succeed as their peers in this sector.

Beyond the BaccaLaureate: acceSS to advanced 
degreeS

It is widely acknowledged that a bachelor’s degree is now necessary for participating 
in the new knowledge economy, but it may not be sufficient. The entry point to many 
of the most highly-paid careers, particularly in the fast-growing STEM (science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, is a doctorate, not the baccalau-
reate. Low-income, first-generation students are underrepresented among gradu-
ate degree recipients in large part because they are less likely to earn bachelor’s 
degrees, the gateway to graduate studies. However, there are large gaps in graduate 
enrollment and attainment even among students who have earned baccalaureate 
degrees.

Using data from the U.S. Department of Education’s Baccalaureate and Beyond 
(B&B) study, we tracked the graduate school enrollment and completion of students 
who earned their bachelor’s degrees in 1993 after ten years. According to our analy-
ses, low-income, first-generation college graduates in this cohort were as likely as 
their more advantaged peers10 to aspire to continue their education beyond the bac-
calaureate to earn advanced degrees. Yet despite such high aspirations, low-income, 
first-generation students were less likely than their peers to earn graduate degrees 
at all levels by 2003. Only 21 percent of low-income, first-generation students 
earned a graduate degree compared to 36 percent of their peers.

10  This analysis compares low-income (under $25,000), first-generation (neither parent has a BA) students to students who were neither low-

income nor first-generation. Given the variables available in the B&B: 93/03 dataset, it was not possible to combine students who were 
low-income only and first-generation only as a group for analysis, so these students were excluded here.

This is due, in part, to the fact that low-income, first-generation students were more 
likely than their peers not to enroll in graduate school at all, 63 percent versus 
52 percent respectively, and at every level. However, it is also due to the fact that 
low-income, first-generation students who did enroll in graduate school were less 
likely to finish. Overall, only half of low-income, first-generation graduate students 
completed their degree programs compared to approximately two-thirds of students 
who were neither low-income nor first-generation.

Just as low-income, first-generation students face barriers to successfully making 
the transition to and through college, they likely experience similar obstacles (e.g. 
lack of information, support, and money) to entering and completing a graduate 
degree program. Additional research is needed to more clearly define the barriers to 
graduate school entry generally and by level and field of study specifically for this 
population. Further research is also needed to identify strategies that work to help 
low-income, first-generation students succeed beyond the baccalaureate.

What accounts for the fact that low-income, first-generation students are less 

likely than their peers to complete college, particularly at the baccalaure-
ate level? As our analysis shows, they face a number of challenges that 

make it difficult for them to be successful in college. They disproportionately come 
from ethnic and racial minority backgrounds with lower rates of college participa-
tion. They also tend to be older, less likely to receive financial support from parents, 
and more likely to have multiple obligations outside college, like family and work, 
that limit their full participation in the college experience. They take fewer classes 
each semester as they balance these multiple obligations, and frequently stop out 
as family circumstances—such as changes in jobs, finances, and health—dictate. 
As previously noted, these characteristics have been shown to be risk factors that 
negatively affect the chances of success in higher education for this population (see 
Chen, 2005; Choy, 2000; Nunez & Cuccaro-Alamin, 1998).

Some of the gaps in attendance and completion patterns reflect the fact that low-in-
come, first-generation students tend to enter college with less academic preparation 
than their peers. For instance, our analysis of NPSAS data shows that low-income, 
first-generation students are more likely to take remedial courses than their most 
advantaged peers in every sector of higher education (except the for-profit sector). 
Other research has found that low-income and first-generation students are less 
likely to have access to and take a rigorous high school curriculum; they also tend to 
lack important study and time management skills, have less confidence in their aca-
demic abilities, and experience more difficulty navigating the bureaucratic aspects 
of academic life due to their lack of exposure to college (Bui, 2002; Cabrera et al, 
2001; Chen, 2005; Cruce et al, 2005; Lohfink & Paulson, 2005; Penrose, 2002; Nunez 
& Cuccaro-Alamin, 1998; Richardson & Skinner, 1992; Terenzini et al, 1996, 2001; 
Warburton et al, 2001). As a result, they tend to have lower levels of performance 
and persistence in postsecondary education.

It’s not just who they are and how they attend college that makes a difference in 
whether or not low-income, first-generation students succeed, it’s where they go to 
college as well. According to the preceding analyses, low-income, first-generation 
students were more than seven times as likely to earn bachelor’s degrees if they 
started in four-year institutions, but less than 25 percent of them did so. Further-
more, only about one in ten of students from this population who entered postsec-
ondary education through public two-year and for-profit institutions transferred to 
four-year institutions within six years compared to half of their most advantaged 
peers. However, while attending a four-year college or university greatly increased 
the chances that a low-income, first-generation student earned a bachelor’s degree, 
it did not guarantee success. Students from this population attending public and 
private four-year institutions graduated within six years at approximately half the 
rate of their most advantaged peers.

Note: The data for other institution types, including private less-than-four year and public less-than-two-year institutions, are 

not included here due to small sample size.

However, even after taking their demographic backgrounds, enrollment characteris-
tics, and academic preparation into consideration, low-income and first-generation 
students are still at risk of failure in postsecondary education (Berkner & Chavez, 
1997; Chen, 2005; Choy, 2000, 2001; Horn & Nunez, 2000; Nunez & Cuccaro-Alamin, 
1998; Warburton et al, 2001). This suggests that the lower performance and persis-
tence rates of low-income, first-generation students are as likely the result of the 
experiences they have during college as they are attributable to the experiences 
they have before they enroll (Pascarella & Terenzini, 1991; Tinto, 1993).

M o v i n g   B e y o n d   A c c e s s

Low-income and first-generation students are less likely to be engaged in the 
academic and social experiences that foster success in college (often referred to 
as academic and social integration), such as studying in groups, interacting with 
faculty and other students, participating in extracurricular activities, and using 
support services (Astin, 1997; Cabrera et al 1992; Billson & Terry, 1982; Lohfink & 
Paulsen, 2005; Nunez & Cuccaro-Alamin, 1998; Pascarella et al, 2003, 2004; Pike 
& Kuh, 2005; Richardson & Skinner, 1992; Terenzini et al, 1996, 2001). During the 
initial transition to college, first-generation students say they delay getting involved 
in extracurricular activities and campus life until they feel they have “their aca-
demic lives under control” (Terenzini et al, 1994; pg. 64). This represents a real loss, 
however, because first-generation students actually derive more benefit from their 
involvement in such activities than their peers (Filkins & Doyle, 2002; Lohfink & 
Paulsen, 2005; Pascarella et al, 2003, 2004; Terenzini et al, 1996).

Lower levels of academic and social integration among this population are inex-
tricably linked to finances and financial aid (Cabrera et al, 1992). Due largely to a 
lack of resources, low-income, first-generation students are more likely to live and 
work off-campus and to take classes part-time while working full-time, which limits 
the amount of time they spend on campus. Increases in financial aid, particularly 
grants, scholarships, and work-study, have been shown to increase the likelihood 
that first-generation students will persist in college (Lohfink & Paulsen, 2005; 
Somers et al, 2004). Somers and her colleagues (2004) found that loans can increase 
persistence for first-generation students; however, they also found that even low 
levels of accumulated debtload can significantly decrease persistence among this 
population. This suggests that first-generation students are highly debt averse and 
may choose to work rather than take out loans to pay for their education. 

Research has shown that students who work up to 20 hours a week actually have 
higher persistence rates than students who don’t work and/or who work more than 
20 hours a week (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005), which we found was also the case 
for low-income, first-generation students. However, we also found that low-income, 
first-generation students are more likely to work more than 20 hours a week than 
students who are neither low-income nor first-generation, 63 to 42 percent respec-
tively, thereby reducing their chances of persisting to degree. Pascarella and his 
colleagues found that working while attending college has a negative impact on the 
persistence of first-generation students because it reduces the number of courses 
they take, the amount of time they spend studying, and the amount of time they 
spend on campus interacting with peers and faculty (Pascarella et al, 2004). Reduc-
ing the work burden through financial aid, including the prudent use of loans, has 
been found to enable students’ interaction with and integration on campus, which 
has the effect of improving academic performance (Dowd, 2004).

Low-income, first-generation students not only face barriers to their academic and 
social integration, they also confront obstacles with respect to cultural adaptation. 
This is due to differences between the culture (i.e. norms, values, expectations) of 
their families and communities and the culture that exists on college campuses. 
First-generation students often experience problems “that arise from [living] si-
multaneously in two vastly different worlds while being fully accepted in neither” 
(Rendon, 1992; pg. 56). At home, first-generation students report that relationships 
with family and friends who did not go to college often become strained and difficult 
to maintain as they are perceived as changing and separating from them, which 
causes intense stress for these students (Lara, 1992; London, 1989, 1992; Olenchak 
& Hebert, 2002; Piorkowski, 1983; Rendon, 1992; Richardson & Skinner, 1992; Ro-
driguez, 1982; Rosas & Hamrick, 2002; Terenzini et al, 1994, 1996).

On campus, first-generation students, particularly those from racial and ethnic mi-
nority backgrounds, often describe themselves as unprepared for the isolation and 
alienation they felt upon entering college (Richardson & Skinner, 1992). First-gener-
ation students are more likely to view the campus environment, particularly the fac-
ulty, as less supportive and less concerned about them (Pike & Kuh, 2005; Terenzini 
et al, 1996), and they are more likely to report having experienced discrimination 
on campus (Richardson & Skinner, 1992; Terenzini et al, 1996). The extent to which 
low-income and first-generation students can participate in and transition across 
these two worlds – which can be aided or impeded by the level of support available 
at home and on campus – has a significant impact on whether they can be success-
ful in college (Phelan et al, 1993).11

Data from the 2004 NPSAS provide a detailed understanding of what and how 
low-income, first-generation students pay for college. The data are drawn from the 
2003-2004 school year.

Low-income, first-generation students, on average, pay less to attend college than 
their higher-income peers whose parents have completed college. This is due to the 
fact that they are much more likely to attend lower cost public two-year institutions 
and much less likely to attend higher cost private four-year institutions. However, 
they and their families are not able to contribute as much to pay for the costs of 
attending college as their peers. As a result, low-income, first-generation students 
demonstrate greater financial need. In this analysis, students’ financial need is 
based on the amount that they and their families are determined to be able to pay 
towards college expenses given their financial resources and their educational 
costs as reported on the FAFSA. This amount is referred to as the Expected Family 
Contribution (or EFC). Financial need is the amount remaining after subtracting 
the student and family contribution from the total cost of attendance. If the amount 
of financial aid received is less than students’ financial need they are said to have 
remaining need. 

11  The research cited in this section is primarily based on the more extensive literature on the postsecondary experiences and outcomes of 

first-generation college students. There is a paucity of research on the collegiate experiences of low-income students. When income or 
socioeconomic status is taken into consideration, it is often “done with the purpose of controlling for an alternative explanation, rather 
than with the explicit purpose of highlighting the differences between socioeconomically disadvantaged students and their peers” 
(Cabrera et al, 2001). The exceptions are cited where relevant in this section (see Choy, 2000; Cabrera et al, 1992, 2001; Terenzini et al, 
2001).

Low-income, first-generation students receive only slightly more financial aid than 
their peers despite having greater financial need. The result is that these students fall 
about $3,600 short of the amount they are determined to need to pay for college, even 
when loan aid is taken into account. When loans are not included in the calculation, 
low-income, first-generation students fall nearly $6,000 short, which they and their 
families must come up with out-of-pocket. This is a major burden on low-income, first-
generation students and their families that represents half of their median annual 
income of $12,100. (By contrast, the median income of students who are either low-
income or first-generation is $44,000 and $70,500 for students who are neither low-
income nor first-generation). To make up the difference, these students would have 
to work 20 hours per week at a minimum wage job in addition to the hours they are 
currently working since these were already factored into their financial aid eligibility.

Meanwhile, their most advantaged peers receive about $5,000 more than they are 
determined to need to pay for college even before receiving loans. If you multiply the 
amount of remaining need (after loans) by the number of low-income, first-generation 
students, there is about $16 billion in remaining need among this population. With-
out including loans, there is about $27 billion in remaining need among this popu-
lation. By contrast, their most advantaged peers receive approximately $28 billion 
more aid than they need without even including the amount they receive in loans.

While the increased reliance on loans in student aid packaging is a concern for all 
students, it is of particular concern for low-income, first-generation students who 
actually graduate with greater loan indebtedness than their peers at the bacca-
laureate level. According to the NPSAS data, low-income, first-generation students 
completing a bachelor’s degree in 2003-2004 had an average cumulative loan debt 
of $21,670 for their undergraduate education compared to $17,646 for students who 
were neither low-income nor first-generation.

Even more disturbing, however, is the cumulative loan debt for students who leave 
postsecondary education without completing their degrees. For instance, low-income, 
first-generation students attending public and private four-year institutions have 
greater levels of cumulative loan debt than their most advantaged peers regardless 
of class level (e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th year) and persistence outcome. The amount of 
loan debt for low-income, first-generation students (and their peers for that matter) 
who leave before graduation is staggering. Low-income, first-generation students 
who left during their first year owed $6,557 on average while those leaving in their 
fourth year owed an average of $16,548. These students must pay back their loans 
without the extra earning power associated with attaining their degrees – and with-
out the parental or family resources that might be available to their more socioeco-
nomically advantaged peers who leave in debt.

Low-income, first-generation students receive the majority of their financial aid, 76 
percent, from federal sources and the majority of their federal aid, 53 percent, is in 
the form of student loans. The trend is similar for their more advantaged peers who 
also receive a majority of their financial aid from the federal government, the major-
ity of which is loans.

Low-income first-generation students receive a smaller share of their grant aid, 37 
percent, from state, institutional, and other sources. By contrast, their more advan-
taged peers receive the majority of their grant aid, 61 percent, from the institutions 
they attend. In fact, the average amount of institutional aid awarded to low-income, 
first-generation students, $2,592, is less than half the average amount awarded to 
students who are neither low-income nor first-generation, $5,557. This reflects the 
fact that low-income, first-generation students are more likely to attend lower cost 
institutions that do not provide as much grant aid, such as public two-year and 
for-profit institutions. However, it also reflects the fact that many institutions award 
their grant aid based on non-need-based criteria or at least they do not restrict 
awards to need-based criteria only. According to the NPSAS data, less than half, 
46 percent, of all institutional grant aid given in 2003-2004 was awarded based on 
need-based criteria. 

The precipitous increase in college tuition in recent years combined with the declin-
ing value of the federal Pell Grant and the trend toward non-need or merit aid at 
both the institutional and state levels has created a perfect storm for disadvantaged 
students like low-income, first-generation students who are working and borrowing 
more than ever yet still finding themselves struggling to cover all of the costs as-
sociated with going to college at a time when they can’t afford not to earn a college 
degree.

Low-income first-generation students also receive a considerable share of their 
federal financial aid, 44 percent, in the form of grants, primarily Pell Grants. While 
the Pell Grant program is the largest single source of need-based grant aid in the 
United States, and the program has grown considerably since its inception in 1973, 
the value of the Pell Grant has actually declined while the costs of attending col-
lege have soared. For instance, the maximum Pell Grant covered 77 percent of the 
costs of attending a public-four year institution in 1980 compared to 36 percent 
today (Cook and King, 2007). This trend has greatly increased the amount that 
low-income, first-generation students must work and/or borrow to finance a college 
education as noted above.

Given the challenges that low-income, first-generation students face, what can 

be done to increase their chances for success? While low-income, first-gen-
eration students confront a number of obstacles to graduating from college, 
there is ample evidence that there are actions that postsecondary institutions can 
take to improve the chances of success for this population, not to mention the rest of 
the student body.

FocuSing on the FirSt year

“Being a first-generation student confers its greatest liability in [the] initial adjust-
ment to, and survival in, postsecondary education” (Pascarella et al, 2003; pg. 429). 
Analysis for this report showed that 60 percent of low-income, first-generation 
students who leave postsecondary education without attaining a degree do so after 
the first year. Implementing strategies such as bridge courses and programs dur-
ing the summer between high school and college, orientation sessions and courses 
before and during the freshman year, and first-year learning communities have all 
been shown to ease the transition to college by helping students get integrated into 
the social and academic communities of the institutions and acquire the skills and 
knowledge needed to become successful learners in those communities (Lotkowski 
et al, 2004; Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005; Smith et al, 2004; Tinto, 2003; Upcraft et 
al, 2004). Given the tendency of first-generation students to delay getting involved 
on campus during the initial transition to college (Terenzini et al, 1994), institutions 
must make a concerted effort to reach out to these tentative students as early and 
often as possible during the first year or risk losing them. Retention programs and 
services are most likely to reach low-income and first-generation students when 
they are offered to and/or mandatory for all students. However, it is important to 
recognize and remove the barriers that may limit these students’ participation (e.g. 
cost) before making such programs mandatory (Pell Institute, 2007).

monitoring Student ProgreSS

Many low-income, first-generation students attend college part-time; as a result, 
their success is not measured so much by quarters or semesters as one course at a 
time. Institutions can help keep students on track in their coursework by developing 
early warning and/or advising systems to monitor student progress and to intervene 
when necessary. Such systems provide information to faculty, staff, and students in 
time to take action and improve performance before it’s too late and a student fails 
or faces academic discipline. Actions triggered by monitoring systems may include 
performance contracts that commit students to receiving advising, counseling, and 
tutoring and/or enrolling in study skills workshops/courses (Pell Institute, 2007). In 
order for such systems to work, there needs to be a high degree of collaboration and 
information-sharing between faculty in the classroom, staff in academic and social 
support programs, and the students themselves (AASCU, 2005; Kuh et al, 2005; 
Pell Institute, 2007). While these programs can help all students succeed in college, 
they have been found to be particularly effective with at-risk populations like low-
income, first-generation students (Abrams et al, 1990; Karp & Logue, 2002-2003; 
Mann et al, 2003-2004; Volp et al, 1998; Willet, 2002).

Providing additionaL SuPPort For StudentS

Given that low-income, first-generation students tend to enter college less prepared 
than other students, institutions must provide a wide range of academic support 
programs – from developmental coursework to learning and tutorial centers to 
supplemental instruction to learning communities – in order to ensure their suc-
cess. Supplemental instruction programs provide peer-assisted academic support 
to students in introductory “gatekeeping” courses with traditionally high failure 
rates, while learning communities enroll a cohort of students in two or more classes 
together to connect learning across courses as well as to establish faculty and peer 
relationships that support success (Lotkowski et al, 2004; Pascarella & Terenzini, 
2005; Upcraft et al, 2004). Developmental education learning communities, which 
link basic skills courses like writing with content courses such as history, have been 
shown to be particularly effective with at-risk students (Engstrom & Tinto, 2008). 
A key feature of effective academic support programs is careful alignment with 
student learning needs in the classroom. The closer the alignment, the more likely 
students will be able to translate the support into successful classroom performance.

Considering the personal hurdles that low-income, first-generation students must 
overcome to succeed in college, they also need and benefit from social support ser-
vices, including academic advising, personal and career counseling, and mentoring 
programs. In particular, they benefit from participation in special programs that 
target at-risk populations, such as low-income, minority, and first-generation stu-
dents. Such programs “scale down” the college experience by providing personalized 
attention, services, and referrals from dedicated staff who serve as “first responders” 
to students’ needs. They also provide a “home base” on campus where students can 
connect with and learn from peers who share common backgrounds and experiences 
about how to navigate the institution and college life (Muraskin, 1997; Pell Insti-
tute, 2007; Richardson & Skinner, 1992). By offering an entry to and a road map 
through the institution, these programs help low-income, first-generation students 
become integrated into the campus community, a key factor in college success (Tinto, 
1993). 

increaSing Student engagement

While support services can greatly improve student performance and persistence, 
we must remember that success in the classroom is the cornerstone around which 
success in college is built. This is particularly true for low-income, first-generation 
college students – many of whom live and work off-campus – since the time they 
spend in the classroom may be the only time they spend on campus engaging with 
faculty and their peers. It is well-established that student academic and social 
engagement is central to student success (Astin, 1997; Kuh et al, 2005; Pascarella 
& Terenzini, 2005; Tinto, 2003). To the extent that faculty can structure classroom 
activities in ways that require students to become more involved in the learning 
process and with their peers, such as using cooperative and problem-based learning, 
they can improve student engagement and success (Braxton et al, 2000). It follows, 
however, that institutions must provide professional development for faculty and 
staff to not only help them acquire a broader range of pedagogical skills, but also 
learn how to effectively use those skills with at-risk populations, including low-
income, first-generation students. 

creating a cuL ture oF SucceSS  

The actions described above are necessary but not sufficient to improve student re-
tention. In fact, “the ability of an institution to retain students lies less in the formal 
programs they devise than in the underlying commitment toward students which 
directs their activities” (Tinto, 2003; pg. 7). Creating an institutional culture that 
fosters student success requires strong leadership from top college administrators. 
Campus leaders must prioritize improving retention as an institutional goal and 
consistently demonstrate their commitment to it through their words and actions. 
This means allocating the necessary resources to retention programs even when 
scarce and providing incentives and rewards to all members of the campus commu-
nity to participate in as well as take responsibility for improving retention. Leaders 
must also strive to organize their retention efforts into an intentional, structured, 
and proactive campus-wide program that requires coordination and collaboration 
among all units focused on the shared goal of improving student success (AASCU, 
2005; Kuh et al, 2005; Pell Institute, 2007). Otherwise, the sum of their actions to 
improve retention will be less than their parts. 

n     n     n

Finally, as Thayer (2000) notes, institutions should keep in mind that retention 
“strategies that are designed for general campus populations without taking into 
account the special circumstances and characteristics of first-generation and low-
income students will not often be successful for the latter.” However, as he contin-
ues, “strategies that work for first-generation and low-income students are likely 
to be successful for the general student population as well.” The academic, social, 
and financial resources (or lack thereof) that low-income students have available to 
them affects the extent to which they can utilize retention programs and services 
available on campus. Institutions must reduce the barriers to their participation in 
such programs – including lack of information, inability to pay, and/or inconvenient 
hours that conflict with work schedules – by offering flexible services that take low-
income, first-generation students’ special needs into consideration (Pell Institute, 
2007).

Evidence from the Student Support Services Program

-geneRATion sTUdenTs:

The federally-funded Student Support Services program, one of the Federal TRIO programs, 
provides services aimed at improving college persistence and graduation rates among low-
income, first-generation, and disabled college students at two- and four-year institutions. 
Such services may include instruction in basic skills; tutoring; academic advising; financial 
aid, transfer, and career counseling; mentoring; and grant aid. There are currently about 950 
SSS programs serving more than 200,000 students at colleges and universities nationwide.

Research has shown that students participating in SSS programs have higher persistence 
and degree completion rates than similarly disadvantaged peers. Furthermore, the more 
contact and/or the longer students participate in the program, the more they benefit from 
it (Cheney et al, 1997; U.S. Department of Education, 2005).
Findings from the “Best Practices” in Student Support Services study (Muraskin, 1997) 
provide evidence of effective strategies for promoting retention among this population. 
The study found that SSS programs with strong records of success shared the following five 
characteristics:
a structured freshman year experience. The programs often serve as the main point of 
entry for participants and as a “home base” to help students adjust to and integrate into 
the institution. The programs strongly structure students’ initial educational experiences by 
playing a major role in course selection and instruction during the first year. 
an emphasis on academic support. Most services are focused on giving students the 
skills and confidence they need to achieve academic success. Programs offer developmental 
instruction in basic subject areas and study skills through courses, workshops, and com-
puter-assisted instructional labs as well as supplemental instruction to provide additional 
support in introductory courses. Services that emphasize group and interactive approaches 
to learning such as peer tutoring and study groups are particularly effective at improving 
student outcomes.

an active and intrusive approach to advising. These programs see their students more 
often than other programs. They take an active and intrusive approach to advising that 
includes meeting with students several times per semester, continually tracking student 
performance and use of services, and checking student progress at mid-term to intervene 
and make referrals as necessary. Programs also focus on the “whole student” in the advis-
ing process using a case management approach.
a plan to promote participation. These programs place requirements on students to 
ensure they make use of and benefit from available services. Students may be required to 
demonstrate their commitment to the program through an admissions screening process 
and/or to sign a contract in which they agree to meet certain requirements to remain in the 
program. Such programs also provide incentives and rewards for participation as well as try 
to remove any barriers by offering flexible scheduling of services.
a strong presence on campus. The directors of these programs have often been with 
their institutions for many years, are well-known and well-respected on campus, and serve 
in positions (e.g. as administrators or on taskforces) that allow them to exercise influence 
on institutional policies and practices affecting disadvantaged students. Given their extend-
ed tenures, these directors are also able to better link their programs and their students to 
the institutions and their services. The most successful programs are part of larger service 
entities such as educational opportunity programs or learning centers rather than stand-
alone programs.

concLUsions   
And RecoMMendATions

For too many low-income, first-generation students, the newly-opened door to 

American higher education has been a revolving one. The unavoidable fact 
is that while college access has increased for this population, the opportu-

nity to successfully earn a college degree, especially the bachelor’s degree, has not. 
The major barrier to the baccalaureate for low-income, first-generation students is 
that vast majority of them begin - and end - their studies in two-year and for-profit 
institutions. Unfortunately, the segregation of low-income and other educationally-
disadvantaged students into the less-than-four-year sector has only gotten worse 
over time. For example, the percentage of Pell Grant recipients enrolled in four-year 
colleges and universities dropped from 62 percent in 1973-74 to 45 percent in 2001-
02, where it remains today (U.S. Department of Education, 2007). In other words, 
nearly one-third of the thirty-year decline in enrollment in four-year institutions 
among Pell Grant recipients has occurred in just a recent three-year period (Morten-
son, 2003). 

What can be done to increase the number of low-income, first-generation students 
who enroll in and graduate from four-year colleges and universities with bachelor’s 
degrees? We offer the following recommendations to practitioners and policymakers 
alike:

Improve academic preparation for college: Taking a rigorous high school 
curriculum, including advanced mathematics, greatly increases the chances that 
low-income and first-generation students will attend college, particularly four-year 
institutions (Choy, 2001; Horn & Nunez, 2000). However, to usher low-income, first-
generation students into advanced coursework without adequate support is to set 
these students up for early failure. To that end, students and their parents need: 
More information and counseling about gateway courses well before high school 
especially since the math track to college starts with eighth grade algebra.

Additional academic and study skill support to successfully complete challenging high 
school coursework, including integrating note-taking, higher-order thinking, time 
management and other academic self-advocacy skills into the core curriculum, given 
likely gaps in their elementary and middle school preparation. 

Greater access to college-preparatory courses, which are either not offered at the  
high schools they attend or are offered in watered-down formats that do not do  
much to prepare them to succeed in college, especially at four-year institutions.  

Teachers who are equipped with the training and skills they need to develop  
challenging course material and to teach rigorous college-preparatory courses,  
including Advanced Placement.

Counselors who have more comprehensive knowledge about the college access  
process and the support and time they need to work with students on their  
pathway to college.

The key to achieving these recommendations is for principals, teachers, counselors, 
and directors of college access programs alike to work together to purposefully cre-
ate a college-going culture in the school’s overall environment.

Provide additional financial aid for college: Targeting more financial aid 
toward this population could greatly expand their options with respect to where and 
how they go to college. With adequate resources, more low-income, first-generation 
students could afford to enroll in four-year institutions or attend full-time, both of 
which would increase their chances of completing college with four-year degrees. 
Unfortunately, funding for the Federal Pell Grant and Work-Study programs has 
not kept pace while tuition and fees have increased dramatically in recent years. To 
reduce the impact of financial barriers, low-income, first-generation students need:

•	

•	

•	

•	

Workshops designed specifically for students - and their parents and guardians -about 
the financial aid process, especially filling out the FAFSA. 

Additional information to improve their financial literacy about their options for 
paying the costs of attendance at four-year institutions, including the prudent use of 
loans. This includes how to budget and use the banking system, the pros and cons of 
credit card use, and other forms of financial literacy to help students better acquire 
and utilize their financial aid.

Increases in grant aid from institutional, state, and federal sources, which will require  
a shift away from merit aid at the institutional and state levels.

Greater assistance with covering “remaining” or unmet financial need, such as 
through the use of expanded work-study programs.   

Increase transfer rates to four-year colleges: Given the economic and other 
realities that force most low-income, first-generation students to begin their studies 
in the two-year sector, there needs to be a greater emphasis on increasing transfer 
rates from two- to four-year colleges. More than 60 percent of low-income, first-gen-
eration students who attend public, two-year institutions aspire to earn bachelor’s 
degrees, yet only 5 percent of them do.  To better facilitate their transfer from two-
year to four-year institutions, low-income, first-generation students need:

•	

•	

•	

•	

A clear vision of the long-term pathway from high school to a two-year college and 
then to a four-year college with guidance from high school teachers and counselors 
during the college planning and choice process.

Effective developmental courses, particularly in mathematics, to address shortcomings 
in their academic preparation.

Strong transfer counseling and planning from academic advisors as well as favorable 
articulation policies. 

Adequate financial counseling and aid (e.g. transfer scholarships) as well as other aca-
demic and social support to ensure successful degree completion after the transition. 

Ease the transition to college: Low-income, first-generation students need con-
siderable support as they make the transition to college. They need validation that 
not only are they capable of succeeding in college, but that they belong on campus as 
well (Rendon, 1992; Terenzini et al, 1994). Strategies that have been shown to help 
low-income and first-generation students include:

•	

•	

•	

•	

Beginning as early as elementary and middle school, exposing students to college tours 
and college and career assessment tools to inspire their interest and knowledge about 
the college environment.

Early intervention through bridge and orientation programs that socializes students to 
the expectations of the academic environment; involving parents also helps them to 
understand the demands of academic life. 

Advising, tutoring, and mentoring by faculty and peers that maintain needed support 
throughout the college years. 

Participation in special programs for at-risk populations that “scale down” the college 
experience for low-income, first-generation students by providing them with person-
alized attention from staff and a place to connect with supportive peers who share 
common backgrounds and experiences.

Encourage engagement on the college campus: Colleges and universities must 
remove the barriers (primarily financial) that prevent low-income, first-generation 
students from fully participating and engaging in the experiences that are associ-
ated with success in college such as living on campus, involvement in extracurricu-
lar activities, interaction with faculty outside of class, and use of available support 
services. To that end, institutions can: 

•	

•	

•	

Offer additional opportunities for work-study to increase the amount of time these 
students spend on campus while meeting their financial needs. 

Focus on increasing interaction and engagement in the classroom in order to make use 
of the only time many low-income, first-generation students spend on campus.

Develop cohorts of study groups that foster campus community and provide an aca-
demic and social support system for low-income, first generation students.

Promote (re)entry for young and working adults: According to a recent report 
by the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (2008), most states cannot meet 
the global competitiveness needs of the country by targeting traditional-age stu-
dents alone.  There must be an effort to help young and working adults get back on 
the college track, many of whom will likely come from low-income and first-genera-
tion backgrounds. Strategies for reengaging these populations include:

•	

•	

•	

Providing support through programs that help adults complete their General Equiva-
lency Diploma, like the Federal TRIO Educational Opportunity Centers.

 Offering college credit for experiential learning in the workplace to expedite degree 
completion.

Developing programs to reach out to and serve students who leave college with a 
limited number of credits remaining to graduation like the program offered by the 
Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education. 

•	

Expanding financial aid eligibility for part-time students and/or providing additional 
resources (e.g. childcare) to promote persistence.

As the United States continues to realize the importance of increasing the educa-
tional attainment of its citizens as the key to its future economic stability in the 
global marketplace, improving postsecondary access and success among underrepre-
sented populations, such as low-income, first-generation students, is paramount. As 
the analysis in this report has shown, there is much work to be done if this growing 
population is to participate and achieve within higher education similar to their 
more advantaged peers. Without action by policymakers and practitioners at all 
levels, it appears that not only will these students be left behind, but so too will the 
United States.

Established in 1981, the Council for Opportunity in Education is a non-profit 

organization dedicated to expanding educational opportunity throughout the 
United States, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Islands. Through its numerous 

membership services, the Council works in conjunction with colleges, universities, 
and agencies that host federally-funded college access programs to specifically help 
low-income, first-generation, and disabled Americans enter college and graduate.

The mission of the Council is to advance and defend the ideal of equal educational 
opportunity in postsecondary education. The Council’s focus is assuring that the 
least advantaged segments of the American population have a realistic chance to 
enter and graduate from a postsecondary institution.
