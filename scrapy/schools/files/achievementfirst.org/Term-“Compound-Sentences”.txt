Term: “Compound Sentences”

Deﬁnition:
A compound sentence contains two independent clauses joined by a coordinator (or conjunction). The
coordinators are as follows: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so. (Helpful hint: The ﬁrst letter of each of the
coordinators spells FANBOYS.)
Two independent clauses are combined using a commas and a conjunction - this is the rule for compound
sentences.
A. I tried to speak Spanish, and my friend tried to speak English. 
B. Alejandro played football, so Maria went shopping. 
C. Alejandro played football, for Maria went shopping.
ANALYSIS: Note how the conscious use of coordinators can change the relationship between the clauses.
Sentences B and C, for example, are identical except for the coordinators. In sentence B, which action
occurred ﬁrst? Obviously, "Alejandro played football" ﬁrst, and as a consequence, "Maria went shopping. In
sentence C, "Maria went shopping" ﬁrst. In sentence C, "Alejandro played football" because, possibly, he
didn't have anything else to do, for or because "Maria went shopping."
