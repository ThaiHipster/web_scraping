Term: “Appositives”

Deﬁnition:
An appositive is a noun or pronoun — often with modiﬁers — set beside another noun or pronoun to explain
or identify it.
In some cases, the noun being explained is too general without the appositive; the information is essential to
the meaning of the sentence. When this is the case, do not place commas around the appositive; just leave it
alone. If the sentence would be clear and complete without the appositive, then commas are necessary; place
one before and one after the appositive.
