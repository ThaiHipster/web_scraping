Selection 2 (Set 1)

Analysis: Lit - Paired Passage
Selection: Choice

This paper scores a 2 for choice because most of the evidence selected, albeit hard to distinguish, is connected to the main idea of the
paper. This paper does not score a three because each paragraph has one piece of evidence, so most of it cannot be connected to the
topic of that paragraph. Additionally, the paraphrased evidence about the bird is not connected to the second body paragraph.
