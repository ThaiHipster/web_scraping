Term: “Insightful Conclusion”

Deﬁnition:
An insightful conclusion includes a realization, nuance, or implication that was not presented by the teacher
and is authentic to that scholar. If, as a teacher, you are struck by the conclusion because it presents an
original thought that you had not considered, the conclusion is insightful.
