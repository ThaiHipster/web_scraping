Term: “Voice”

Deﬁnition:
The word choice ‘voice’ refers to the personality and individuality of the words being used. While writing
should still be academic in style, certain words like “dominoed” and “ﬁre starter”, both used in the World War
II standard bearer, are more colorful, speciﬁc, and engaging than other bland choices, making them more
memorable and powerful to the reader.
