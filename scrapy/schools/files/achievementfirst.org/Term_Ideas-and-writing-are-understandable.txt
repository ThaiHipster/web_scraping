Term: “Ideas and writing are understandable”
Definition: If ideas are understandable, then you, the teacher and grader, knows what the student is 
attempting to say. The key thing here is that the student may not necessarily say exactly what they mean, 
but you understand what they mean nonetheless.

If writing is understandable, then the sentences and words are put together in such a way to provide 
understandable ideas.

Example

“In I Am Offering This Poem, by Jimmy Santiago Baca, the poet is giving the idea that love is providing 
you with all that you need, for example guidance and comfort. When in love, humans tend to feel safe 
and as if they belong, knowing there is someone that’s always there that cares for them. Love is not 
something humans can just dispose of: it most likely will always be there.”
Analysis: This thesis has understandable ideas. The problem is that this writing is not clear. These 
sentences have a number of awkward clauses which make them incomplete sentences.
