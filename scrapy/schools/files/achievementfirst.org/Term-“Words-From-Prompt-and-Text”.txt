Term: “Words From Prompt and Text”

Deﬁnition:
Words that are in the prompt and the text are spelled and copied correctly. Character names and places are
examples of words from the prompt and text, as are content-speciﬁc vocabulary words. These words might be
more challenging to spell independently, but scholars are merely required to copy them.
