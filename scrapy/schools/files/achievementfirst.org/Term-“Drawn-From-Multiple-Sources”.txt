Term: “Drawn From Multiple Sources”

Deﬁnition:
If a scholar has two texts to reference, evidence comes from both texts, even if one text is used to refute a
counterargument. If a scholar has multiple texts, the scholar is using a roughly equal amount of evidence
from the minimum number of credible texts required to reference. The Common Core Standards require
scholars to be able to integrate information from multiple sources, and this addresses that standard.
