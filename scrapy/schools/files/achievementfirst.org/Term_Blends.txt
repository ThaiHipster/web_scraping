Term: “Blends”
Definition: A blend is an introductory phrase or dependant clause before a piece of evidence. The purpose 
of a blend is to more smoothly blend the evidence into the paragraph and to avoid dropping in quotes 
abruptly.

Example

Non-Example

“Baca states, ‘and let you warm yourself by  
this fire…’”

“Maya’s rape led to her deliberate silence. ‘When I 
refused to be the child …’”

“Maya stated, ‘When I refused to be the child …’”

“Every one, as he is bound to preserve himself…”

“As a result, ‘every one, as he is bound to preserve 
himself…’”

“Article 19 of the UDHR states, “Everyone has the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression…’”

Analysis: These examples do not have any 
introductory phrases and are therefore less 
smoothly presented.
