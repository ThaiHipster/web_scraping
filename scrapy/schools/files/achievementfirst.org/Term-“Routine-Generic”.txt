Term: “Routine, Generic”

Deﬁnition:
When the beginnings of sentences are routine, generic, stock phrases, this is less engaging and purposeful
than having unique, content rich, beginnings to sentences. While routine, generic sentence starters may have
some variety, they are boring and predictable and do not add much interest for the reader.
