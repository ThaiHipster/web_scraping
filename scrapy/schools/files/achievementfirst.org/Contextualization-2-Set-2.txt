Contextualization 2 (Set 2)

Analysis: Lit - Rumble Fish
Contextualization: Framing

do bad things.” This provides one piece of framing about the task.
Contextualization: Context

This paper scores a 2 in context. While this paper attempts to contextualize the ﬁrst piece of evidence, stating, “I say rusty James is a
cliques because he always ﬁghts,” there are too many assumptions that the scholar is making about the reader. The reader does not
know who Rusty James is, who he ﬁghts, where he ﬁghts, or why he ﬁghts. The reader doesn’t know that Rusty James is speaking or
to whom he is speaking.
