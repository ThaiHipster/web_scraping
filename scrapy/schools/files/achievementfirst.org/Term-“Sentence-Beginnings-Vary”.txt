Term: “Sentence Beginnings Vary”

Deﬁnition:
In order to avoid monotony the author makes an attempt to vary the way he or she begins his sentence. There
are no sections of the paper where multiple sentences begin with the same word. See
http://www.ehow.com/how_7906729_vary-sentence-beginnings.html for more suggestions on varying
sentence structure and beginnings.
