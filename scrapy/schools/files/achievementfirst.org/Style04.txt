Analysis: Lit - Antigone.True Tragic Hero

AbsTrAcT/summAry:
This paper maintains appropriate distance. Present tense use is slightly problematic, but not egregious. 
Parallelism is rough but present. However, this paper is not nearly to the level of a variety of rhetorical 
devices and consistent verb tense, and has a fair amount of work before it can earn a five.

criTerion 1: regisTer
The paper uses third person and maintains an appropriate distance. There are few colloquialisms and no 
contractions. However, in several places the writes does not use present tense.
One example:

• 

“[Haemon’s] suffering leads him to die beside his bride, waiting till Creon was in sight before 
stabbing himself with his sword.” à note that “till” is a colloquialism.

criTerion 2: crAfT
Some parallelism is present. For example:

• 
• 

“… because of his mistakes, his pride, his great downfall, and his suffering.”
“Ismene’s great fall from nobility, her mistake of not helping her sister bury Polynices, and the 
great suffering she has to endure after having to watch her sister die are some…” (This is an 
awkward example, but still an attempt.)
