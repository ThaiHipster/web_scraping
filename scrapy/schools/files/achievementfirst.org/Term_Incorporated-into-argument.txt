Term: “Incorporated into argument”
Definition: These key nuances should be smoothly incorporated throughout the argument as they typically 
influence various subarguments. If a paper is a tapestry, then key nuances are threads that need to be 
interwoven through the cloth when appropriate. For example, if an author is analyzing the theme of a poem 
and analyzes a motif in paragraph one but fails to incorporate that idea into paragraph three, then he or she 
has failed to incorporate the key nuance. These terms serve to encourage complexity of analysis and doc 
oversimplified development.

Example

Non-Example

Please see the “Yeats” SB analysis under Ideas.

Please see the “Locke” SB analysis - The idea of 
the social contract theory somewhat starts in the 
introduction with the thesis statement and then 
somewhat addresses it (but not specifically) in the 
last body paragraph. This key nuance is introduced 
but not incorporated into the argument. If it was 
included, the ideas in this paper would possess 
enhanced clarity and depth.
