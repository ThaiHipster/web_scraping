Position 2

Analysis: Paired Passage
Position: Thesis

This paper scores a 2 in the thesis criterion because each paragraph attempts to have a clear and focused topic sentence that generally
addresses the prompt. These are in third person. There is no thesis, or overarching statement tying these three paragraphs together. This
keeps this paper from scoring higher.
Position: Assertion

This paper scores a 2 for the assertions because most topic sentences are relevant to the topic of the paper. Since the topic of the paper
isn’t explicitly stated, it is unclear if they are all directly relevant to the topic of the paper. Speciﬁcally, it is unclear how the third topic
sentence relates to the paper without having read the bullet points.
