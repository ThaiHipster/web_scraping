Term: “Verbs Are In A Consistent Tense”

Deﬁnition:
One tense should be used for most of the writing and should not change if the time frame or state for the
action has not changed. For example: About noon the sky darkened, a breeze sprang up, and a low rumble
announced the approaching storm Verb tense should be purposefully changed to indicate a change of time
frame from one action or state to another. For example: The children love their new tree house, which they
built themselves. (see http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/601/04/ for more examples)
In writing about historical events, past tense should be used; in writing about literature, present tense should
be used. This is trickier to do consistently when writing about both in one essay, like with an allegory.
