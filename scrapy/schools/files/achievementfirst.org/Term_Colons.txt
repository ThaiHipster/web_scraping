sentence blends into the evidence. Please review colon rules when teaching this to students to make sure it 
is grammatically correct.

“At the end of the novel, Grant asks Paul to explain 
Jefferson’s dignity to his family: ‘tell them he was 
the bravest in that room’ (p.225).”

“At the end, Grant is talking to Paul outside the 
school, and he replies something that Jefferson 
does. ‘But tell them he was the bravest in that 
room’ (p.225).”
