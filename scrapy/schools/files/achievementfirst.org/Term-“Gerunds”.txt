Term: “Gerunds”

Deﬁnition:
A gerund is a verbal that ends in -ing and functions as a noun. The term verbal indicates that a gerund is
based on a verb and therefore expresses action or a state of being. However, since a gerund functions as a
noun, it occupies some positions in a sentence that a noun ordinarily would, for example: subject, direct
object, subject complement, and object of preposition.
