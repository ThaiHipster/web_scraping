The mission of Achievement First Amistad High School, a 
college-preparatory public charter school in New Haven, 
Connecticut, is to provide students from historically-
underserved communities with a top-quality education to 
prepare them for the rigor of college work and help them 
flourish on college campuses. AF Amistad High’s approach 
includes a rigorous, college-preparatory course of study, 
tutoring, intensive college counseling, and robust athletic and 
elective programs.

n  AF Amistad High serves predominantly Black and Latinx 

students from Bridgeport and New Haven. Our communities 
face a pronounced racial achievement gap, a factor that 
contributes to Connecticut’s troubling status as the state with 
the largest achievement gap in the nation. Approximately 
85% of AF Amistad High students will be the first in their 
families to attend a four-year college or university.

n  Because of their longer academic day and year, students 
at AF Amistad High receive nearly 400 hours of additional 
classroom time compared to their peers in traditional New 
Haven district schools.

n  AF Amistad High’s rigorous curriculum emphasizes core 
academic subjects: literature, composition, history, math, 
and science. Students are required to take four full years of 
coursework in each of these subjects. 

n  Over 90% of students take at least one Advanced Placement 
course, and approximately half of the school’s students take 
two or more AP courses.

THE CLASS OF 2020 IS AF AMISTAD HIGH’S ELEVENTH GRADUATING CLASS

GRADING POLICY & PHILOSOPHY
 
n  AF Amistad High uses a 100-point grading scale, with 70 as 

the minimum grade to pass a course and 50 as the lowest 
published grade. Weighted Grade Point Average (GPA) is 
calculated as the arithmetic average (total quality points 
divided by credits) of all weighted courses taken. 

n  The faculty strives to protect against grade inflation; 

consequently, “A”s and “B”s are hard-earned. While AF 
Amistad High students may have overall lower GPAs than 
their peers in traditional district schools, this is not a reflection 
of their academic tenacity or ultimate mastery. Rather, it is a 
reflection of the high expectations to which students are held.

COLLEGE MATRICULATION & PERSISTENCE 

Achievement First seeks to disrupt the “norm,” in a country 
where enduring inequities mean just 9% of students from low-
income families earn a college degree by age 24. Our graduates’ 
projected college completion rate is 55%—six times the national 
average—and we’re working hard to ensure that rate grows until it 
equals, then surpasses, the graduation rate for our country’s most 
affluent students.

AF Amistad High supports graduates beyond high school by:

n  Matching all students with a college success counselor who 

provides individualized outreach and support.

n   Building cohorts of AF graduates at schools with high expected 

college completion rates for students of color.

85%

OF AF AMISTAD HIGH STUDENTS 
WILL BE THE FIRST IN THEIR 

FAMILIES TO ATTEND COLLEGE.

BEYOND ACADEMICS

All students take elective courses that are embedded in the
school day. In addition, 75% of AF Amistad High students
participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

During their high school careers, members of the Class of 2020
will participate in at least three summer programs, allowing them 
to augment their rigorous academic experience with exploratory 
learning experiences beyond the classroom. Thirty five percent 
of students participated in a pre-college summer program and 
63% of students participated in a summer internship.
