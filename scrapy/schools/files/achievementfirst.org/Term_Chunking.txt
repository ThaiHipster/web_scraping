Term: “Chunking”
Definition: Chunking is when the author removes words and phrases from the middle of a quote to focus 
on the juicy parts of the quote and to make it more readable. Example: “Chunking is… an important skill.” 
“Chunking can also occur” when authors chop up the quote so they can “more easily incorporate it into a 
clear sentence.”

Example

“Maya is woken up out of her sleep and thinks she has killed the baby, ‘[b]ut after closer investigation’ 
Maya is surprised to find ‘[t]he baby slept touching my side’ (289). Her mother whispered, ‘See you don’t 
have to think about doing the right thing. If you’re for the right thing then you do it without thinking’ (289).”
