Term: “Obvious Fragments and Run-ons”

Deﬁnition:
A sentence fragment lacks a subject or verb. It usually sounds incomplete. A run-on sentence has too many
independent clauses joined together; while obvious run-ons have clearly smashed together too many ideas,
rambling sentences, where numerous independent clauses are joined by conjunctions that just seems to keep
going and going are not necessarily considered obvious run-ons.
