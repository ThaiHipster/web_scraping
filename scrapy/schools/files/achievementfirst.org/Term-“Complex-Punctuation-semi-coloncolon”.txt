Term: “Complex Punctuation (semi-colon/colon)”

Deﬁnition:
You can use a semi-colon to join two independent clauses. Joining two independent clauses this way implies
that the two clauses are related and/or equal, or perhaps that one restates the other. Use semi-colons between
items in a list that already involve commas.
Use a colon after an independent clause when introducing a list, after an independent clause when
introducing a quotation, or between two independent clauses when you want to emphasize the second clause.
