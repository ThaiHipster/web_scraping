Term: “Ideas and writing are precise/ concise”
Definition: Precision means that what is said is exactly what the author is trying to say - connotation, word 
form, usage, accuracy, etc.

Concision means that all words are necessary and contribute to the meaning of the sentence - there is 
almost nothing that can be edited out.

Example

“Shakespeare employs the opposition of light and dark in Romeo and Juliet, a tragic play where two 
lovers are destined to be together, or so they believe. From the moment Romeo lays eyes on Juliet, he 
notices that she brings forth an entity of light to his perpetual darkness like a glowing orb; however, 
Juliet’s brilliance eventually blinds Romeo, causing him to defy the feuding Capulet and Montague 
families. This opposition reveals that love disorients and distracts and makes lovers oblivious to the 
inevitable darkness.”

Analysis: This thesis is insightful and nuanced. The word choice heightens precision (“employs”, “entity 
of light to his perpetual darkness”, “love disorients”, “inevitable darkness”) and the command of sentence 
structures and language leads to concise writing.
