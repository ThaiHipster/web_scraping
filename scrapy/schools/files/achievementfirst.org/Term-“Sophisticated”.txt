Term: “Sophisticated”

Deﬁnition:
A sophisticated introduction contains the parts of an introduction (hook, framing, and thesis) in a scholarly
way. A sophisticated introduction does not feel choppy or repetitive, and the parts ﬂow seamlessly into each
other. A sophisticated introduction frames the argument in a context that is broader than the task, text, and
prompts.
