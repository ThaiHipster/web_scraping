Term: “Reasonable Essay Structure”

Deﬁnition:
Without being too formulaic, essays with reasonable structure have a clear introduction and conclusion that
are multiple sentences in length bookending multiple body paragraphs with appropriate content. The ordering
of these body paragraphs and the intentionality to that order is scored in the ‘assertions’ row of the rubric.
