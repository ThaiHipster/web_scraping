RE: Financial Reports as of 12/31/20 
 
Dear Board Members: 
 
Attached are the reconciliations and financial statements through December 2020.   During the

The school has positive net income, positive working capital position, and good cash position.  
Additional information on the school’s finances is contained in the financial summary and financial 
statements.
