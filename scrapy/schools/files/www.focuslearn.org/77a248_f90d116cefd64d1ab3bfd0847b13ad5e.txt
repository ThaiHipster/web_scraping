CAREER ADVISING POLICY 

 

 

 

      | 7/2020 

This policy on career advising will be reviewed at least once every two years and made available to students, 
parents, guardians and custodians, local post-secondary institutions, and district residents. The policy is posted 
on the Focus website. 

MODEL CAREER ADVISING POLICY: 1 

1. 

 

 Focus students will have ample opportunities throughout the school year to register for Ohio Means Jobs K-
12,  and  Career  Cruising  Online  Career  Portfolios. Students  will  explore the  online tools and  resources 
offered  by  these  two  career  planning  systems  such  as;  resume  building,  college  prep  assessments-
SAT/ACT, real-world budgeting, learning more about specific career interests, in-demand jobs, possible 
occupations, and potential salaries. 

Therefore,  students  are  strongly  encouraged  to  link  selected  career  pathways  to  their  coursework  by 
completing  at  least  three  activities  using  Ohio  means  Jobs  K-12,  and/or  Focus  secondary  online  career 
planning  system  Career  Cruising  accordingly  to  appropriate  grade  level  9-12.  Additionally,  the  CTE 
instructors will extract activities, and lessons from Career Connections Learning Strategies offered by the 
Ohio Department of Education. It is our goal to help students to connect schoolwork to one or more career 
fields through real work experiences, hands-on activities, and other implementation strategies. 

 

2.  

CAREER ADVISING  

  

There are three major positions (Academic Advisers, CTE Instructors, and CTE Director) to which Focus 
provides  career  advising  to  students in  grades  9-12.  To  meet  the  needs  of  our  student's  career  interests, 
Focus Academic Advisers, CTE Instructors, and /or CTE Director will personally meet with each student 
at  least  once  yearly,  to  discuss  individual  student  career  explorations,  academic  progress,  and  post-
secondary  options.  Student’s  progress  will  be  documented  using  student  journals  in  DASL  -  Data,  and 
Analysis for School Leadership. 

 

Updated: C. Bishop

  The Academic Advisers oversee the transcripts and records for each student. Each student will meet 
with the Academic Adviser to review their credits, assist in course selection, and discuss graduation 
plans.  Additionally,  the  Academic  Advisor  will  also  coordinate  testing  required  for  high  school 
graduation as well as have information for the college entrance exams such as the SAT/ACT. For 
qualified students looking to enhance their high school experience, the Academic Adviser can assist 
in participation in College Credit Plus. 

  The Career & Technical Education (CTE) Instructors of Focus aim to ensure that students who 
participate in the CTE programs (Career-Based Intervention, Exercise Science & Sports Medicine, 
Interactive  Media,  Business  &  Administrative  Services,  Vocational  &  Job  Training  and  Industry 
Credential Only) gain valuable work experience while in school, understand the relevance of their 
academic courses, complete the requirements to earn their high school diplomas and transition into 
institutions of higher education and/or the workforce.  

 

  The Career & Technical Education Director oversees the CTE department, and is responsible for 
planning, developing, and implementing various CTE school-wide events throughout the year for all 
students. Each event is strategically designed to holistically provide career readiness opportunities, 
raise career awareness, career planning, and personal and social development. 

Listed in the chart below are the various events that are hosted throughout the year for all students.

 Intervention for At-Risk Students 

There are several methods Focus uses to address students who are at risk of dropping out of school. 
Below is our implementation progress once a student is identified as at risk of dropping out of school. 
 

Updated: C. Bishop

  Referrals can be made by directors, teachers, and support staff by verbal and/or written communication 
and  then  is  documented  into  student  journals,  using  our  DASL  -  Data  and  Analysis  for  School 
Leadership.  

  Student  Services  help  students  to  overcome  social  and  emotional  barriers  that  interfere  with  the 

student’s ability to obtain their educational, and personal goals 

 

  Retention Specialists help students to develop a consistent means of transportation to and from school; 

bus passes are giving out to assist. 

 

 

Intervention  Department  helps  students  who  require  extra  intervention  assistance;  an  Individual 
Education Plan is developed. Within the IEP academic goals, age-appropriate transition assessments 
and measurable postsecondary goals are written and implemented for students.  

 

  Career- Technical Education Department helps students that are facing a financial crisis and are labeled 
economically disadvantaged by assisting them in job readiness training, employability preparation and 
placement,  off-site  educational  opportunities,  and  gaining  employment.  Students  who  are  suffering 
from financial difficulty often are in jeopardy of dropping out of school.

career-technical education) being coordinated to reinforce the mastery of the identified Individual Education Program

activities is a system working together to assist in meeting the student's goals, both during and after high school.  –

COLUMBUS STATE 

 

Columbus State Community College offers two high school partnership programs that can help high 
school students make successful transitions from high school to college.  

 

Dual Enrollment 

Dual Enrollment allows high school students to take college classes without traveling to a CSCC location. 
Unlike the PSEO Program, Dual Enrollment classes are offered in high school with high school teachers 
who meet the same educational standards as CSCC instructors. Students don't have to travel, and college-
level courses fit more easily into a busy high school schedule. Dual Enrollment home page 

Post-Secondary Enrollment Options (PSEO) 

This program allows students currently enrolled in high school to take Columbus State degree-oriented 
college-level classes before receiving a high school or home school diploma. The classes are taken on one 
of our campuses or at one of our Regional Learning Centers. PSEO home page
