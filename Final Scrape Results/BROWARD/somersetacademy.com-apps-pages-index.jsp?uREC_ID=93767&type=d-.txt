SOMERSET ARTS CONSERVATORY IS NAMED ONE OF THE BEST IN THE NATION
U.S. Secretary of Education, John B. King, Jr., announced today that Somerset Arts Conservatory has been named a 2016 National Blue Ribbon School. Somerset Arts Conservatory is one among 279 public and 50 private schools receiving this honor. Somerset Arts Conservatory was one out of four schools in Florida to receive this honor.
Schools are nominated for the award by the state department of education, and then complete a comprehensive application about school practices. Schools may apply for status as Exemplary High Performing—among the top schools in a state—or Exemplary Achievement Gap Closing—schools making the fastest progress in the their state in closing achievement gaps among student subgroups.  
Our administration will represent Somerset Arts Conservatory at a two-day awards ceremony in Washington, D.C. to celebrate our hard-won achievements.
