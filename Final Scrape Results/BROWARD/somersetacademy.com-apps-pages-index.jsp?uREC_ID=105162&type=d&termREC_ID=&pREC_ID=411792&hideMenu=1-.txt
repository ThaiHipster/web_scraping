Somerset Academy Charter School - Chapel   Trail   Campus
is serviced by    Academica
Academica is one of the nation's longest-serving and     
most successful  charter school service and support organizations. The    Company 
was founded  in 1999 on the principle that each charter school is a    unique 
educational  environment governed by an independent Board of    Directors  that best 
knows  the right path for its school, and Academica's  mission is to  facilitate   
that Governing Board's vision. Academica has a    proven  track-record  developing 
growing networks of high performing  charter   schools.
Academica's services include facilities, finance, staffing     and human resource coordination, as well as bookkeeping, budgeting, regulatory     compliance and financial forecasting. 
Academica serves the largest number of high-performing     schools of any charter school management organization in Florida. Academica was    the first company in the state to seek SACS accreditation for the schools it     serves, and all of the schools it serves are either fully accredited or in the     process of obtaining accreditation.
