Somerset Achievements
NAHS Raises Homeless Awareness!
In September and October, National Art Honor Society participated in Miami-Dade Homeless Trust Roofs Rising Project.  Roofs Rising is an art installation intended to teach our community about the need for housing.
In September and October, National Art Honor Society participated in Miami-Dade Homeless Trust Roofs Rising Project.  Roofs Rising is an art installation intended to teach our community about the need for housing.
This year in honor of Homeless Awareness Day, the Homeless Trust teamed up with the Board of County Commissioners to create a one of a kind project in order to spread awareness with an artistic theme. 
Each participating individual/group were given small wooden houses that were to be painted and designed to express our own unique creations.  The houses were then painted the same color on the top to be grouped together as a grand mosaic of 1100 painted miniature houses which represent the actual number of beds needed to house Miami’s street homeless. 
The mosaic of houses were displayed for 2 weeks at the new Brickell Center at the final display at 701 South Miami Avenue Miami, Fl 33130. 
And if you know of any landlords who want to rent their units, let them know to visit RentConnect at www.homelesstrust.org/rentconnect
