Works Cited, Bibliographies, and Internal Reference Citations
Whether are quoting directly or paraphrasing information you found in a book, article, or website. you MUST acknowledge the source of the information. Within the body of your paper, this is called an internal Reference Citation or Parenthetical Documentation.
At the end of your paper, you should include a Bibliography of sources used or a Works Cited page. This list all books, magazine and newspaper articles, as well as websites that you used when creating your final product. Items on this page are listed alphabetically by the last name of the author or by the title if there is no author. There are rules that we follow to create this documentation. The two most common sets of rules are: 
MLA (Modern Language Association) style, and APA (American Psychological Association) style.
The following links will assist you in using MLA style. For more information, please ask your teacher.
