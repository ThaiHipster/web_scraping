																						Attendance																			
Staff
As delineated in the Somerset Academy Student-Parent Handbook, all absences      must be reported to the Attendance Clerk within 48 hours of       the absence in order for it to be excused.  After 3 consecutive           absences, only a physician's note will be accepted to excuse the                    absences.
All letters must be submitted to the Main Office or emailed to  the:
Elementary Attendance Clerk, Maggie Oharriz at 
moharriz@somersetacademy.com
Middle/High Attendance Clerk, Lily Mokhtary at 
lmokhtary@somersetacademy.com
After the 48 hour window has elapsed, absences 
will                  not
 be excused.  
GENERAL ATTENDANCE PROCEDURES
COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE
 1. All children who have attained the  age of six years or who will       have attained the age of six years by February 1 of  any school year, or who        are  older than six years of age but who have not yet  attained the age of    16       years  or age specified by state statute, whichever is  older, except    as          hereinafter  provided, are required to attend school regularly     during the          entire 180-day  school term. 
2. A student who attains the age of 16 years during the  school year is        not subject to compulsory school attendance beyond the date  upon which he      or    she attains that age if the student files a formal  declaration of             intent   to terminate school enrollment with the School Board.  The                 declaration must  acknowledge that terminating school enrollment is      
likely      to reduce the  student's earning potential and must be signed by   the  child   
and parent. A  student who attains the age of 18 years during    the  school       year is 
not  subject to the legal sanctions for    compulsory  school              attendance. 
3.  Students under 16 years of age may not be permanently  withdrawn  from      school  for any 
reason unless expelled through Board action or  covered       by    an  exemption allowed by Florida Statute. 
4. Compulsory  school  attendance requirements may be met by               attendance in a home  education  program, Although  180 days is the standard         requirement for  compulsory school  attendance;  Florida Statutes requires   a        longer term for  Department of  Juvenile Justice  Programs. For    students     in       those programs,  the compulsory  school attendance     requirement is     consistent      with state law  and  regulations.
PATTERNS OF NON-ATTENDANCE 
1. Non-attendance for instructional  activities  
 is established       by tardiness, early-sign-outs, or absences  for all or any part         
of  the day. The maximum number of days that  a student may be absent       without  
 acceptable documentation is 5 in a  marking period. After    6      days of absences,  
 excused or unexcused,  students will be        reported,     as required by law, to the  
 district for an         intervention as they     are   exhibiting a pattern of        
non-attendance.   
2. A  student who has had at least five unexcused absences, or             absences   for which  the  reasons are unknown, within a calendar month,        or  10  unexcused  absences, or  absences for which the reasons      are      unknown   within a  90-calendar-day period, may  be        exhibiting a       pattern of   non-attendance.
 3.  Unless acceptable documentation  is   available,  an        accumulation of daily 
 absences  (excused or  unexcused)  by          tardiness, or early sign-outs that equals 
5  days  (30      hours)      in  a  marking period  or 10 days (60 hours) within two       
marking      periods  may  establish a pattern of           non-attendance. 
4.  Habitual truant means a  student has  15   unexcused              absences  within 90  calendar days with or without the    knowledge        or  justifiable  consent of  the child's parent or legal        
guardian,  is  subject  to  compulsory school attendance  at      Somerset     Academy 
Charter.
DRIVING PRIVILEGES AND ATTENDANCE
 Florida Statute 322.091 requires school   districts to           report to the Division of Highway Safety  and Motor         Vehicles       (DHSMV)  the names, dates of  birth, sex        and  social security numbers of     students ages  14-18  who         accumulate  15 unexcused absences in any      consecutive 90 calendar   day  period. This       will   result in a        suspension of a  license for those                   students         who  possess one, or a  postponement of the          ability to acquire       a driver’s   license  for  those        students    without    a  current   permit or  license.   Districts              are       also  required     to  hold  hardship hearings if                  requested  by  a   student whose      license     has               been   suspended.
CONSEQUENCES RELATED TO TRUANCY
 1. A child who is found to be truant may be taken to the  Juvenile          Assessment Center or other locations that are  established by the     school      district to receive students who are absent from  school. It     is the         responsibility of the Law  Enforcement  Officer to call the    school                 to determine  if   the child is legitimately    out of school.  
2. Students 14-18 years  of age who have  15 unexcused absences       within 90 calendar  days  and have a driver's license will  have          their  driver's license suspended by the Division of Highway    Safety        and  Motor Vehicles or will not be issued a license if                        they  apply  for one.
STUDENT ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE TIMES 
 According to Florida state law, the school is responsible for students     only 30  minutes prior to and 30  minutes after  a  school    activity.     Due  to these supervision restrictions, we urge     all students  to ARRIVE ON SCHOOL CAMPUS AFTER     7:00A.M. AND TO BE OFF CAMPUS      BY 3:00  PM  (1:15  PM during    early  release days), unless the      student is    attending a school-sponsored activity. Students who     stay        after  school must be under the strict supervision of a faculty  or     staff           member  and must  remain in their designated areas for        tutoring,   make-up     work,  practices, and  or rehearsals.
EXCUSED ABSENCES 
Students must be in school unless the absence has been permitted or        excused for one of the  reasons  listed below. 
1. Illness of student. 
2. Illness  of an immediate  family member. 
3. Death in the  family. 
4. Religious   holidays of the  student's own   faith.         
5. Required court appearance or subpoena  by a law          enforcement agency. 
6. Scheduled medical  or dental appointment.
Please be advised that for an excusable absence Somerset Academy requires       that all parents must report the absence within 2 school days following the         absence. The absence will not be overturned after the two day grace period.      Any    absence is unexcused until the school receives a written notice to      excuse  the     absence from the parent or provide documentation of illness       from  a  physician     or   public health unit. A parent may only excuse five      absences  per semester. 
After   five absences, proper documentation is       required by a  physician, or        court    appointed official. After five       absences the  student will go in front      of  the    school’s attendance       committee for  review. Only the attendance         committee  is    authorized     to offer  exceptions to the current policies and        procedures. Six          unexcused  absences in a high school class will result in        failing the       semester     for all classes that have six absences. 
High school              students  will not be    allowed  to make up any work for unexcused absences.          Students will have  two    days  after an  excused absence to complete all        work    for their  instructors. Any   work  not  completed on time will be           considered  a     zero. Only the school’s    attendance  committee can     determine    exceptions   and    grant extensions.
UNEXCUSABLE ABSENCES 
 1.	For 1st period only, for every five unexcused absences students will receive a referral from their first period teacher. The number of unexcused absences will still reset at the beginning of every quarter. 
2. Students without a completed Certificate  of Immunization indicating  compliance with the current required  schedule of immunizations will not  be allowed to attend classes until  this  document  is provided or a waiver is obtained. Absences due  to non-compliance   with immunization   requirements shall be considered unexcused. 
3. For students transferring into   Broward County, including but not      limited to  foster  care students, or a homeless  student,  a  temporary       30  day waiver of  both health examination documents and  certificates      of     immunization may be  granted. 
4. Students who have  been  externally  suspended may be offered an              opportunity  to participate in an alternative to  suspension  program.       If    they do not  attend, the assigned days,  the  absences will  be        considered        suspensions.
TARDINESS
(Tardiness is defined as a student not being in the classroom when the          class is scheduled to begin.) 
1. Parents must follow the same process to  excuse a tardy as they do      to excuse an absence. 
2. Excessive tardiness will  be addressed on a  case-by-case  basis to     determine if a pattern of non- attendance exists.  Non-attendance for          instructional activities is established                   by          
 tardiness,        early-sign-outs, or absences for all or any part of the day. Four tardies in        any  class, during any portion of the day, throughout  the               semester will result in one  unexcused absence. 
3. Tardies and absences will be reset at the   beginning of      each Semester.
4. Tardiness to any class without documentation   may be             considered  unexcused. 
5. Habitual tardiness is   defined as being tardy 5         times within   a   marking  period. 
6. The  Attendance Committee has the discretion to                excuse tardiness for    extenuating
circumstances.

2. Excessive early sign-outs will be  addressed on a case-by-case          basis to  determine if there is a pattern of                non-attendance. Non-attendance  for  instructional activities is          established by  tardiness, early-sign-outs,  or  absences for all    or      any part of the day. Only  the attendance committee  can     reverse        decisions made based on early sign outs.
