												What is a Charter School?									
														Charter schools are public schools that operate under a performance contract, or a  
“charter” which frees them from many regulations created for traditional public schools 
while holding them accountable for academic and financial results. The charter 
contract between the charter school governing board and the sponsor details the 
school’s mission, program, goals, students served, methods of assessment and ways 
to measure success. 
     The legislative guiding principles behind charter schools are to meet high standards 
of student achievement while increasing parental choice; align responsibility with 
accountability; and provide parents information on reading levels and learning gains of 
their children. Charter schools are intended to improve student learning; increase 
learning opportunities with special emphasis on low performing students and reading; 
and measure learning outcomes. Charter schools may create innovative measurement 
tools; provide competition to stimulate improvement in traditional schools; expand 
capacity of the public school system; and mitigate the educational impact created by 
the development of new residential units.
