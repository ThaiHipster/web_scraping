												Somerset Academy, Inc. 									
Somerset Academy, Inc.
Somerset Academy, Inc. (hereinafter “Somerset”) was founded in 1997 with the opening of its first school, Somerset 
Neighborhood Charter School, in Miramar, Florida. Serving a population of 50 students in grades kindergarten 
through five, this small neighborhood school consisted of two trailers: one serving twenty
‐
five students in grades 
kindergarten through two and the other serving twenty
‐
five students in grades three through five. 
In only its second 
year of operation, Somerset Neighborhood’s students achieved the highest Stanford Achievement Test (SAT) 
Mathematics scores in the State of Florida. 
The success of the school gave birth to the innovation of multi
‐
age, 
multi
‐
level classrooms, which has been the basis for Somerset elementary schools philosophy ever since.  
Somerset Neighborhood  Charter School was one of the first charter schools in the state of Florida to seek and receive 
accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS/CASI) in 1998. 
As the Somerset District 
continued to develop new schools over the years, it carried on its vision and philosophy and applied for SACS/CASI 
accreditation in pursuit of academic accountability and excellence. Today, Somerset’s governing board, represents 
sixteen (16) high performing charter schools across Miami
‐
Dade and Broward Counties. By no means is this the end 
of the Somerset vision to provide high quality and equitable education to the community. Already in the works are 
new campuses and building expansions to be completed for the next academic year and school years to follow.
THE SUCCESS OF THE SOMERSET DISTRICT 
The term “academic success” best describes Somerset’s learning 
community both collectively as an organization as well as at each individual school. As of the 2007
‐
2008 academic 
school year, all Somerset elementary and middle schools achieved an “A “ grade collectively while the high school 
achieved a high “B” on the State of Florida’s A+ Accountability Reports. 
Each of the Somerset schools has been 
recognized at local and state levels for high academic achievement annually while serving a high percentage of 
minority students (86% average). In 2006, Somerset had the #1 middle school in the state making academic progress 
and the school with the highest learning gains in Reading in the State of Florida.   In 2008, Somerset Academy High 
School’s graduation rate of 99% far exceeded the Broward County, State of Florida, and U.S. average graduation 
rates. The 2008 graduating class accepted nearly $1.2 million in scholarships to colleges all over the nation.
WHAT CONTRIBUTES TO OUR DISTRICT'S SUCCESS?
It is the commitment of each Somerset charter school to uphold high 
expectations for all, to create safe and caring learning environments, and to maintain a culture where parents, 
teachers, students, governing board and community stakeholders work as a cohesive team. It is this common 
commitment aligned with the vision to set high standards in developing life
‐
long learners that has yielded Somerset’s 
success. 
The driving force behind this success is the motivation and dedication of each stakeholder to not just 
maintain that vision, but to continuously strive to reach beyond it from year to year. The result has been a school 
system that is characterized by successful students, innovative educators, exceptional administrators, committed 
board members and engaged parents.
THE SOMERSET TEAM 
All Somerset schools implement the “neighborhood” school paradigm in their operations to 
consistently maintain a small school environment where students can excel and parents are included in the process. 
Under the guidance of Somerset’s governing board, each individual school takes ownership of its program while 
maintaining and supporting a collective vision. 
Each principal is given the authority to adapt curriculum and develop 
strategies for success, hire highly qualified staff, and determine scheduling and programming that meet the needs of 
their communities. The administrator also supervises the budget with guidance from Academica, a charter school 
service and support organization, when needed, and answers to the local school district (sponsoring agent), state, 
and federal government. 
As a cohesive team, the governing board, on
‐
site administrators, and staff create the 
collaborative managerial infrastructure for school operations that continues to drive Somerset’s success.
