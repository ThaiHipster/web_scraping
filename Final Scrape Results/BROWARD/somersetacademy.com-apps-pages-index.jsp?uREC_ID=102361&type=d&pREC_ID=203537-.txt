The Somerset Academy Guidance Department works with students, parents, and     the community to foster a positive and supportive learning environment. The        Guidance Department office is located in the Middle/High Administration         Building. 
The essential role of the counselor is to be a student advocate. Counselors    assist with personal, academic, social, and post-secondary concerns that can       aid  the student in order to reach their full potential. Support systems such      as  individual/group counseling are an integral part of the counseling  program     at  Somerset Academy. When a student is upset, a counselor is always  available     for  them for support. Classroom activities and presentations are  developed      throughout the year to assist students with their personal,  social, career,    and   educational development.
