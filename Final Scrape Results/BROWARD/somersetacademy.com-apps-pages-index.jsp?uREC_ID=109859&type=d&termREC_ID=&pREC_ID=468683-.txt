What is a BRACE Advisor?
It is an acronym that stands for 
BR
oward Advisors for Continuing Education
. I assist high school students with their post-secondary plans, i.e. plans after high school, and provide students with scholarship and financial aid information to help finance their educations. A BRACE Advisor is not a Guidance Counselors.
How do I look for scholarships? 
 I look online, receive information from workshops I attend, and get information from other outside sources. 
To get the information from me, please fill out my scholarship survey at 
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1CDEbzz4X0ccnR05TZOYrNrUz_tknh0qWInggooAASAw/viewform
You can register for scholarships on 
www.fastweb.com
 and 
www.scholarships.com
 and 
www.collegeboard.com
. 
NEVER pay for scholarship searches or applications. If you need money, why would you pay for it? 
BRACE Tips
Be aware of      deadlines for all scholarships.
Be sure to print      legibly or type all scholarship materials.
Be sure that      your email address is appropriate for interpretation in a business      environment.       
Continually      update your resume.
Be sure your      essays are grammatically correct.
Do NOT rely on      spell check.
Do NOT leave      paperwork until the last minute.
“Received by” means      that the foundation must have your application on their desk by that date.      It does NOT mean “postmarked” by that date.
READ all      instructions/requirements carefully.
Most colleges      and universities prefer online applications. Check your college email      account or telephone the admissions office approximately 7 business days      after you applied to be sure all information was received. Follow through.      Details are a very important part of the process.
Visit your BRACE      Advisor to learn more about 2- & 4-year colleges/universities,      technical/careers schools, specialty schools, military academies, ROTC      scholarships, military recruiters, apprenticeships and more.
Essays,      recommendation letters and extracurricular activities may make the      difference in scholarships and admissions.
Be sure to      choose schools that are BEST for you and your family!
