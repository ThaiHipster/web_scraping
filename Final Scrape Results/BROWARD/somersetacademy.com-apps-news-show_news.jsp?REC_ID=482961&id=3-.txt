Visual Arts Conservatory Students Create Portraits for Filipino Children!
In October and November, students in the Visual Arts, Arts Conservatory program created portraits for a group of Filipino children for the Memory Project.  
The Memory Project is a charitable nonprofit organization that invites art teachers and their students to create and donate portraits to youth around the world who have faced substantial challenges, such as neglect, abuse, loss of parents, violence, and extreme poverty.
In October and November, students in the Visual Arts, Arts Conservatory program created portraits for a group of Filipino children for the Memory Project.  
The Memory Project is a charitable nonprofit organization that invites art teachers and their students to create and donate portraits to youth around the world who have faced substantial challenges, such as neglect, abuse, loss of parents, violence, and extreme poverty.
They want the portraits to help the children feel valued and important, to know that many people care about their well being, and to act as meaningful pieces of personal history in the future.  For the art students, we want this to be an opportunity to creatively practice kindness and global awareness.
Photos of children and teens from global charities operating residential homes, schools, and care centers in a number of different countries every year are taken.
The participating art teachers are then provided with full-page color prints as well as digital copies of those photos, along with plastic sleeves to protect the finished portraits.  The art teachers then work with their students to create the portraits, and we hand-deliver them to the kids.  They always try to have several different portraits for each child, created by different art students and based on different poses.
Finally, a video is made of each delivery to share with all of the art students and teachers involved.  Since 2004, they have created more than 100,000 portraits for children in 43 countries.
