Join Parents for Charter Schools!
As the parent or guardian of a charter school student, you made the choice  to send your child to a charter school.  You know firsthand about the  benefits a charter school offers - whether it is a smaller and safer learning  environment, more personal attention to your child's learning needs, or greater  opportunities for you to be involved with your child's school.
 But did you know that your child's school and other Florida charter  schools are struggling to receive adequate funds?  Or that charter schools  are under increasing scrutiny by the school district and the state?
If you would like to be one of a growing number of parents and  guardians who are speaking out for their charter schools, please consider  joining the new Parents for Charter Schools.
MEMBERSHIP IS FREE!
As a member, you will receive these benefits:
•A regular e-newsletter that contains information about current legislation  and issues that affect your child's school and all charter schools in the state.  
•Regular updates on Charter School issues can be viewed from  Facebook.  Become our friend at  www.facebook.com/ParentsForCharterSchools
•Information on how you can make an impact locally or in our state's  Capitol when charter school funding and legislative issues arise.
