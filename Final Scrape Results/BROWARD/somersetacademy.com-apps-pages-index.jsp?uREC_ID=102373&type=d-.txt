PTSO Vision
 - Working towards making Somerset Academy, Chapel Trail Campus, a school that meets the emotional, social, and academic needs of our children.
PTSO Values
Collaboration
: We work in partnership with a wide array of      individuals and organizations to accomplish our agreed-upon goals. 
Commitment
: We are dedicated to promoting children's      health, well-being, and educational success through strong parent, family,      and community involvement. 
Accountability
: We acknowledge our obligations. We deliver      on our promises. 
Respect
: We value our colleagues and ourselves. We      expect the same high quality of effort and thought from ourselves as we do      from others. 
Inclusivity
: We invite the stranger and welcome the      newcomer. We value and seek input from as wide a spectrum of viewpoints      and experiences as possible. 
Integrity
: We act consistently with our beliefs. When      we err, we acknowledge the mistake and seek to make amends.
