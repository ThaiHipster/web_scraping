College admissions, scholarships, and volunteer service opportunities are a few of the reasons why students sometimes need an official high school transcript. If you need an official high school transcript please follow the procedures below. 
(Before submitting an official transcript request form please be sure that an unofficial copy, which can easily be printed from Virtual Counselor, will not suit your needs) 
Get a copy of the Official Transcript Request Form. You can either print one out from this site (found on the bottom of this page), or pick one up in the front office.
Fill out the form completely and correctly 
(forms without student numbers cannot be processed).
Submit the form in the front office. 
**Please note that transcript requests made via email cannot be processed.
***CLASS OF 2010 and EARLIER, we cannot process your transcript requests. All transcript requests for the CLASS OF 2010 and EARLIER must be submitted to Broward County Records Retention.

** Former students must pay $5 per transcript. Cash or Online Payment.
