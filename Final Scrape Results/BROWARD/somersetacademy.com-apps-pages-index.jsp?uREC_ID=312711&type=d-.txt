												Student Volunteer Hours									
Student Volunteer Service Program 
All students graduating with a 24-credit diploma are required to complete a  minimum of forty (40) documented hours of service learning in order to graduate.  The Service Learning and Volunteer Service Program is divided into three tiers;  Tier I Graduation, Tier II Florida Academic Scholars, Tier III Silver cord,  which all required different levels of hours. All Service Learning hours must be  documented on the appropriate Service Learning log sheet and turned into the  guidance department. Students are required to keep records of their log sheets.  
SENIORS MUST SUBMIT STUDENT VOLUNTEER HOURS REQUIRED FOR GRADUATION BY FEBRUARY 1ST.
General Guidelines for Tiers I, II, & III  
1. All services must comply with the policies of the School Board of  Broward County, Florida. 
2. Student volunteer service hours may be earned in both the school and or  the community. 
3. Services for which a student or an organization that a student belongs  to receives financial/or other substantial compensation will not be counted.  This would include revenues from ticket sales or donations. For example,  participation in a car wash sponsored by a club would not count as community  service. An exception to this guideline would be if the organization is donating  the profits (less expenses) to a bonafide charity. Another example, the school  chorus puts on a performance at which admission is charged and all of the  proceeds less the cost of cleaning their uniforms is donated to a charitable  organization. 
4. Participation in and travel to theatrical musical 
performances,   festivals or community events will count as service hours if 
both (a) and  (b)  below are met:   
A. The performance meets an identified community service need. 
B. The  performance is not a fundraiser for the organization nor the student is paid, or  receives academic credit. For example, students participating in the Florida  Youth Orchestra or school bands/orchestras may receive hours for performing at a  retirement home, charitable and civic events or for a non-profit agency. 
5. A student may earn volunteer hours by helping at an event or performance  
at which admission is charged or a donation collected, providing that the    
student is not a member of the organization benefiting from the event. For    
example, a student, who is not a member of the Drama Club, may volunteer  to   
usher and collect tickets at a drama club production and earn service  learning hours. 
6. Rehearsal and practice time will count for volunteer service projects to  be performed or conducted specifically to meet a community service need. 
7. Service learning hours documented for community service as part of  non-credit granting workshops, programs or conferences will count as volunteer  service. 
8. Fundraising activities for non-profit charities will count as volunteer  service hours as long as the activity complies with Broward County School Board  Policies 6206 and 6208 and providing the student is not volunteering for an  organization that benefits the school (i.e. a booster club fundraiser). For  example, a high school student government may hold a candy sale and donate all  of the profits to the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. However, the conduct of  the project including depositing the money in the school account must be in  accordance with School Board policies. Service hours may not be earned based on  the amount of funds raised or products sold. 
9. Volunteering at events or programs sponsored by governmental agencies  will count. For example, students serving as an usher at public institutions  such as the Broward Center for the Performing Arts or Coral Springs City Center  are eligible to receive service learning hours. 
10. Activities organized by profit making or non-profit organizations to  address a community service need will count as volunteer service hours. 
11. Services performed for day care centers, retirement homes, and animal  hospitals count for volunteer hours. A student may earn service hours by  volunteering with a doctor, lawyer or dentist only when “pro-bono” work is being  performed. For example, if a doctor volunteers to give physical examinations to  school athletes, a student may assist and earn service hours. 
12. Service performed on staff at non-profit athletic or music camps for no  financial compensation will count as volunteer services hours. 
13. Time out of class may not be used for hours, however a maximum of five  (5) volunteer hours per week can be earned by participation in an organized,  supervised and approved peer tutoring program in which the tutoring takes place  when school is in session. However, the tutoring sessions cannot take place  during any of the tutor’s academic classes. 
14. Service hours will be awarded for students volunteering on political  and issue campaigns. To receive service hours, a student cannot be paid for  working on the political campaign. A student is not eligible to receive service  learning hours for volunteering on the political campaign of a school board  employee or in school board elections. Students are not eligible to receive  service learning hours for campaigning or being engaged in political activities  during the school day and on school campuses. 
15. Students may receive volunteer hours for helping at religious  institutions as long as those hours do not include participation in a religious  service, teaching religion or proselytizing. For example, a student is not  eligible for service learning teaching Sunday school, singing in the choir or  serving as an altar server. However a student may receive service hours for  assisting in landscaping, clean up days or volunteering in the day care center.  In addition, students serving as teen aides (i.e. copying materials, walking  kids to bathrooms, assisting with supervision) are eligible for service learning  credit as long as the student is not teaching religious studies. 
16. In general, service rendered directly to a for profit institution or  organization will not count. Volunteering at a “For Profit” summer camp does not  qualify for service learning. Please note that the collection of a fee does not  determine the “Not For Profit” status. The State of Florida issues a 501(c)(3)  certificate to “Non Profit” organizations. 
17. Service Learning Hours shall not be granted to students who volunteer  at for profit summer camps (i.e. Sagemont, American Heritage, Pine Crest).  Students who volunteer at governmental sponsored or non-profit summer camps  shall be eligible to receive Service Learning Hours for their work. 
18. Service for a student’s family or family business will not count.  
19. Service performed as the result of disciplinary action taken by the  school or the courts will not count. 
20. Participation in campus or competitive activities such as athletics,  plays, debate meets, etc. will not count. 
21. Service performed as an academic requirement, other than that performed  as part of the approved volunteer service learning courses will not count.  
22. Babysitting, or similar services, performed for an individual family,  will not count. Babysitting services for school related activities will count.  
23. Volunteer hours may not be certified by a family member or fellow  student 
24. Service hours will not be awarded for any in kind or monetary donations  of any kind including canned food collections, toy collections, etc. For  example, a service hour value cannot be established for the donation of a  specific number of cans of food. The time spent collecting the cans of food (as  long as it does not occur during the school day) can count. 
25. The number of service hours that are earned cannot be doubled or in any  way increased by any agency or school for student participation in a specific  project. Agencies found to be practicing the doubling of hours will be removed  from the list of those agencies approved by the programs. 
26. Participation in self-improvement workshops, clinics, conferences or  conventions will not count for volunteer hours. If workshops, clinics, etc. have  a specific service component, the hours spent on that activity can count. 
27. Hours spent helping others (not family members) in disaster  preparations or clean up may count. In this instance the Prior Approval form may  be waived. A letter from the parent or guardian indicating that the volunteer  service was performed with their permission must be submitted with the log  sheet. For example, students volunteering their time to assist neighbors in  putting up and taking down hurricane shutters will count towards service  learning. 
28. A student may receive service hours credit for the time donating blood  at an off-campus facility or after school. Donation of blood during the  student’s school day does not qualify for service learning. However, a student  who donates blood at a church/synagogue blood drive is eligible for service  learning credit. 
Appeals Process 
If a student’s volunteer hours have been denied by the school based Student  Volunteer Service Coordinator the student may appeal that decision to the  Department of Student Activities and Athletics. The appeal must be in writing  and a copy of the Log Sheet referencing the hours in question must be attached.  The letter must contain a telephone number and address at which the party  initiating the appeal can be reached. 
Volunteer forms can be found in the front office. See attachments for  copies of the Tier I, Tier II/III and Approval Form.
See Ms. Mendez in the front office to turn in volunteer  hour forms.
