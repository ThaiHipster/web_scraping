Freshman Year
In freshman year, the main task is to simply get accustomed to high school and broaden your horizons.  We recommend that you:
Explore all th
at Stony Point Academy has to offer.
Read, read, read.
Try some new things: clubs, athletics, ASB, and yearbook are a lot of ways to move beyond your familiar comfort zones and take some risks
In March, students select their sophomore year courses.  The school counselor meets with all freshman to discuss their class selections.  The principal, student advisor, and the office manager are available to help with the selection process.​
Sophomore Year
Sophomore year, especially towards the later part of the year, is a time when the college begins to come a little more into focus.
Fall
Take challenging courses; keep exploring and refining interests.
Students take the PSAT in October.  Results come back in December and can be a good indication of how they'll do on the real SAT or ACT.
Winter/Spring
We recommend that sophomores visit Bay Area colleges for a college tour.  Mostly this is an opportunity just to begin to learn about what's out there.  Understanding the difference between big and small, or urban, suburban, and rural, can help get a jump on college thinking.
Sophomores have 1 on 1 meeting with the school counselor about their futures.
Sophomore parents nights with our school counselor begin to help them understand SAT's, A-G requirements, and GPA.
Spring break is a great time to visit colleges.
Summer
Take the SAT Subject Tests in June, if appropriate.  Talk with your teachers about these.
Visit colleges, get an internship or a job, relax and get ready for a long junior year!
Junior Year
Junior year is an important time in the college planning and preparation process
Focus on classes and intellectual endeavors - this is a particularly important year in terms of college admission.  Choose and commit to your favorite extracurricular activities.  Seek leadership roles when you can.
Oct:
Students will again the the PSAT.  This year's score is more important than last year's as it may qualify you for the National Merit, National Achievement and/or National Hispanic scholarship programs.
Nov:
Juniors will take a practice SAT and ACT to understand the difference between the tests, and also attend an evening meeting to discuss testing and test prep.
Jan:
Official kick-off of the college process.
Juniors begin one-on-one meetings with our school counselor.
There is also an informational presentation on the college process presented by the school counselor.
Have a family discussion about factors that may affect the college search, e.g., finances, proximity to home.
Parents: if you are setting any specific parameters, now is the time to share them with your son/daughter! 
Plan and register for junior-year testing (usually the March SAT or April ACT).
Spring
Most Stony Point Academy students will take their first 'real' SAT or ACT in March or April of their junior year.
Put yourself on mailing lists of any colleges of interest.
Attend college informational meetings in the Bay Area (if you're on colleges' mailing lists, they'll invite you).
Apply for summer programs/jobs/internships.
As you begin to wrap up your junior year, keep all of the papers that you wrote over the year.  Some colleges ask for a graded paper as part of the college application, so don't throw these things out!
If you plan to play a varsity sport in college complete the NCAA Clearinghouse form.
Think about which teachers you'd like to have to write your college recommendations and chat with them about it (plan on having two write on your behalf).
End the school year with a "working" college list of 10-15 colleges/universities.
Summer
Have a great summer.  Get lots of rest and relaxation!
Senior Year
The first semester of senior year will be focused on completing college applications (in addition to course work and extra curricular's).
August
Figure out if and when you are going to take the SAT/ACT/SAT Subject Tests and register for them.
Brainstorm personal statement ideas.
Make sure you're on the mailing lists of all colleges/universities of interest.

Schedule a meeting with the school counselor.
Attend informational meetings with colleges both at school and off-campus.
Check-in with the teachers who are going to write your letters of recommendation.
Register for the CSS Profile if you plan to apply for financial aid.
Log on to the Common Application's website www.wommonapp.org and register.
October
Begin applications to any colleges with Rolling, Early Action and/or Early Decision admission programs.
If you are applying to any college or university Early Action or Early Decision, you must notify your school counselor and teachers and give them the appropriate forms by October 1.  Also, send your SAT/ACT/SAT Subject test results to the colleges/universities to which you are applying ED/EA.

Work on common App, CSU & UC applications.

College & Career Readiness 
P
reparation for post-secondary success is a multi-dimensional process. Students begin by learning about themselves and exploring careers, then create plans and develop the skills and knowledge to accomplish their goals. 
In addition to A-G college preparation course work, our students participate in college coursework starting in 9th grade through a partnership with the Santa Rosa Junior College.
Stony Point Academy has established relationships with the Sonoma County Community for apprenticeship opportunities in the business and service sector.
