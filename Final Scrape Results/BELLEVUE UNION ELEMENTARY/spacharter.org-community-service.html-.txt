Community Service
The benefit students receive  from community service is the satisfaction of incorporating service into their lives and making a difference in their community and country.
​
The intangible benefits alone—such as pride, satisfaction, and accomplishment—are worthwhile reasons to help the community. ​
When we share our time and talents with our community we :
• Solve Problems
• Strengthen Communities
• Improve Lives
• Connect to Others
• Transform Our Own Lives
Stony Point Academy considers service to others an integral part of good citizenship.  ​
