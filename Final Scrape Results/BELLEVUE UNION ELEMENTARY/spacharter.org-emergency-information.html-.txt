Emergencies or Disasters
In the event of a major disaster (fire, earthquake, flood) during school hours, children will be kept at school. They will be released only to previously authorized individuals. The exception would be in the event of a serious injury, when we would send the child for emergency medical care. It is absolutely imperative that the Emergency Card and Student Release Card at school be kept current and accurate. It is the primary document used to locate you or the people you've designated to pick up your child. Your child will 
NOT be released to anyone who is not on this emergency card.
Telephone systems quickly become overloaded in an emergency, so please do not try to phone the school. Instead, come to school or send a person from your emergency card to pick up your child. Check your local radio and  television stations for information during local disasters and emergencies. Mark your local radio station on your radio's dial. Your child should be made familiar with these stations and their roles in local emergencies.
