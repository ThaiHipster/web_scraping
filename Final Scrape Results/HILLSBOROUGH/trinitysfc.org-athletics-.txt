Athletics at Trinity School for Children plays an important role in our community. Our students are encouraged to participate in one sport or man
y from the fifth grade through eighth grade. Through athletics, we teach students how to take reasonable risks, try new activities, develop a refined sense of their bodies in space, and engage in problem-solving on the fields of play.
Our sports programs are designed to create the "student athlete"¬ù who is able to demonstrate hard work, sportsmanship, and respect on and off the playing field. It is our goal to make sports an area that all students will want to explore. We believe that the skills learned on the fields bring positive results to the classroom as well as adding to the development of the whole child.
We compete at a high level of play. Our dedicated coaching staff works diligently to ensure that the lessons and values learned on the fields translates to the manner in which they will conduct their lives in the future. While it is important to teach proper athletic skills, we never lose sight of the fact that there is a higher purpose - to build character, to understand the meaning of commitment, and to foster the ability to collaborate.
Our teams have been successful. With the overwhelming support of our staff, parents, and our community, our programs will only continue to grow and improve for years to come.
We believe that Trinity School for Children is a model for what it truly means to be a "student athlete"¬ù.
