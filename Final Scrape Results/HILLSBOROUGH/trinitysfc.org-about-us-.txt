Welcome to Trinity School for Children
Imagine developing a school where students can discover, learn, experiment, and create th
eir
 own knowledge. Imagine a school where students feel safe and trust their environment. Imagine a school where experiences are created to allow students to integrate and accommodate their own personal feelings and ideas within an ethical framework that encourages taking risks and the creation of civic ideals. Such a place exists at Trinity School for Children. Since 1999, we have been working diligently to live up to the ideals set forth by Lucy Sprague Mitchell, Bank Street College, New York. Replicating their laboratory school has been a dream for all of our founders, educators, students and families involved.
