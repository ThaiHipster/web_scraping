						 S 					
unny Wolf Charter School works hard to provide quality education. Through the help of donations and special programs our school is able to incorporate many in-school and out-of-school field trips. Many of these field trips are sponsored by our PTO. Some of these field trips include going to McGregor Park, Table Rock, the Grants Pass Art Museum, and Science Works. Some of the in-school field trips consist of the Portland Opera To Go, Wildlife Safari, Oregon Coast Aquarium, and The Bee Girl. Please help students at SWCS experience the world by donating to us. Here are some ways you can help.
