Welcome to all current and future Sunny Wolf Charter School Families. Our school offers a wonderful and unique educational experience to students in grades Kindergarten through Grade 5. We maintain high academic standards and for this we were named a 
Model School for the State of Oregon.
In addition to academics, we offer many 
Art and Music opportunities, a full Science Program, a Computer Lab, PE, a 
School Garden, and many special events. Throughout the year, our students perform community service in the surrounding community.
Sunny Wolf Charter School is also a Title 1 School that gives supplementary help in Math and Reading for those students who need it. Our class sizes are small and there is a teacher and an assistant in each K-5 class.
We have a cook on site who prepares a 
nutritious breakfast, lunch, and snack each day.
Our entire staff is dedicated to providing the 
best all around education for each and every student.
We look forward to meeting you and sharing our school.Thanks for being a part of our school community.
Sincerely,
Penelope DiGennaro, Director
