Garden
The garden is put to bed in part and partly planted with goodness for the cafeteria. We used nearly all of the garlic harvested from last year, so students planted three times more garlic for the cafeteria. They also planted broccoli, purple broccoli, and kale. Lots of power foods to feed the growing brains!
