Sunny Wolf is a very special place to learn and grow. Eight of my grandchildren have attended and all have excelled academically and socially. The director, teachers and staff are dedicated to the mission and goals of this public charter school. It is a jewel in this small community attracting students from other areas. Thank you, this Grandma is so grateful to see my grandchildren enjoy learning and wanting to go to school every day!
