Cafeteria
Great preparations went into our Thanksgiving meal at Sunny Wolf as nearly 200 people were served a delicious luncheon. We have amazing cooks and they worked for a week to bake, roast, chop, slice, and create from scratch an unbelievable feast! We are so thankful for our loyal cook staff to provide homemade and nutritious meals to our students everyday. Students created art for ambiance with collages of gobblers, pine cone turkeys, Native American rainsticks, autumn trees and thoughts of sharing. Sunny Wolf Charter School is full of dedicated families, children, and staff. We are grateful everyday for our community of learning. Happy Thanksgiving!
