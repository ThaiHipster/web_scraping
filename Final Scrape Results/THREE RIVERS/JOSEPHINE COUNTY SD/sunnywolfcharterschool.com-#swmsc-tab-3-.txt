Technology is embraced and integrated into lessons.
Each classroom has a set of tablets or computers for student use at Sunny Wolf Charter School. Tablets have been donated or purchased for each child in grades 3, 4, and 5. Students are directed to sites and activities that enhance and reinforce new concepts and skills learned during classroom instruction. Children are more interactive with technological support and even create digital portfolios for all subject areas. In grades K, 1, and 2, computers are set up as part of a station rotation during centers. Sunny Wolf also has a computer lab that students use for keyboarding skills, research projects, and whole group lessons. 
 21st Century Skills 
Each year students are introduced to a variety of exceptional performances.
Portland Opera To Go outreach program for elementary schools includes small group instruction and whole school performance. Through sponsorships children are exposed to highly artistic productions of Opera that inspire our students. The Meriwethers present the story of Lewis and Clark through original music and video production enabled by a partnership grant with Britt Festivals. Students were able to understand the rugged endeavor that led to settlement of The West through the Meriwethers’ outstanding talent and connections with children. Rogue Valley Symphony Quintet brings lively contemporary chamber and classical music to students at SWCS. 
 Performing Arts 
Sunny Wolf Charter School takes pride in Science Education.
Students are active participants in science throughout the school year. FOSS Modules and Science Kits form the foundation of science instruction and are sequenced to make sense to children. Science instruction includes real world problem solving, investigations, testing, recording, and analysis. Students explore engineering through design and construction. Science instruction is engaging and not limited to the classroom setting. Students explore science of the surrounding grounds, the school garden, nearby Wolf Creek, and even venture to the Pacific Ocean for Outdoor Education. 
 Investigation 
Students are inspired by local artists.
Through grants writing and donations, our students are immersed in art lessons with local experts. Students have the chance to explore collage, pottery and clay work, felting, three dimensional sculpting, art journaling, watercolors, and more visual arts. Students are given instruction technique, and encouraged in the use of the medium of the day by dedicated and talent instructors. High quality materials are provided to students for projects. Local artists work with children individually and encourage creativity. At the end of each session, students have created works of art ready to share at home.
