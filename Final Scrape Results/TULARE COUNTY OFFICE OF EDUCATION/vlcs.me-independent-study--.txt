Home Study - Independent Study
Independent Study offers a fantastically creative approach to education.  VLCS Independent Study serves students in grades K-12 with a combination of on campus enrichment courses and at-home learning. 
Students meet with their teacher one-on-one every week for one hour. During this meeting the teacher will review the student's completed work, give needed assessments, and work with the student in any areas needing more attention.  Parents are encouraged to be a part of these meetings with students in grades K-6. 
Additionally, students are encouraged to participate in the enrichment courses offered on campus.  Courses vary in times, length of course, and days offered.

Students in grades 7-12 are required to attend specific classes on campus.  We find some subjects are difficult to be self-taught and are better learned in the classroom.
Science
Math
Writing Lab (helping students focus on the mechanics of writing and grammar)
Harcourt and Houghton-Mifflin curriculum is provided at no cost to the students.
Students enrolled in Independent Study are part of the VLCS Family.  Students and families are encouraged to attend the monthly assembly, Tricky Tray, the Fall Carnival and all school performances and events. 
There are limited openings.
