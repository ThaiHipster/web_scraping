VLCS School Dress Code
VLCS adheres to a strict dress code – the dress code is enforced whenever students are on campus including the After School Program. Additionally, students must adhere to the dress code when representing VLCS off campus. VLCS students show their individuality through character and leadership. We have a high standard for learning and expect an academic environment. By putting first things first, academics before fashion, students learn to become leaders.
Dress Code Violations: If a student is out of dress code, they will be issued a Dress Code Warning; parents may be called to bring a change of clothing to school that is compliant with our dress code. On the fourth Dress Code Warning, the student will receive a one day suspension.
Clothing
All garments must fit appropriately and be in good repair. Except outer wear, all visible garments (including layered tank shirts and leggings) must conform to the policies below as they pertain to shirts and pants/bottoms. Undergarments are not to be visible at any time.
Shirts: Must have a collar and may be button down or polo styles with short or long sleeves. Shirts may not be see through. Approved colors: black, blue, yellow, white, or grey.

School Spirit Days
School Spirit Days and Dollar Dress Days: On these occasions, students will be allowed to dress according to a given theme (e.g., Pajama Day) or may pay $1.00 to wear clothing of their own choosing. All clothing on these special days must be appropriate to the learning environment; proper fitting, no spaghetti straps, no open toe shoes, etc. Proceeds from the Dollar Dress Days will be used  to benefit the students at Valley Life Charter School. 
School Spirit days will be on Friday. Special T-shirts will be available to purchase for these days only. 
Students may also wear other T-shirts that have been earned by participating in a VLCS Event such as 
Science Olympiad, Step Up, School Field Trips etc.
