VLCS Athletic Program
Athletics on a school campus brings a fun spirit to the overall atmosphere.  It also brings a lot more responsibility on the student athletes part.  They are students first, working on academics, and athletes second, competing and representing VLCS. 
Valley Life Charter School is now part of a 6th-8th grade sports league.  
Fall Sports (August-October): Co-Ed Flag Football and Volleyball
