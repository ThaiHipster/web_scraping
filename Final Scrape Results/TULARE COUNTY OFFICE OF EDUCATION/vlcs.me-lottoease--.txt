Please read these instructions prior to starting the application:
Do not use lotterease for students that are currently enrolled at Valley Life - UNLESS you have a student currently enrolled in our Independent Study program currently, and you are looking for a classroom based program in the fall.
Also, if you are enrolling two students that do not currently attend Valley Life - you must add all of your students prior to applying for a lottery.
Lotteries are listed by the grade the student will be in - NEXT YEAR!  Failure to place your child in the appropriate grade, will move them to the bottom of the wait list.
You will receive an email from Valley_Life_Charter_School@lotterease.com  Please be sure that it is not going to your spam folder.  You will receive multiple confirmations, when setting up an account, adding a student, entering a lottery, and after the lottery.
