Parent Group
Valley Life Charter values parental involvement.  Families are encouraged to volunteer 40 hours per year. This can happen in many ways.  The Parent Group is a great way to get involved and meet other families. 
Parent group meetings are the 3rd Thursday of each month at 6:15 PM at the Akers Campus in room D3.  Parents are also welcome to join administrators on the first Friday of the month at 8:30 - for Coffee and Conversation.  We will be looking for parents to be on our Lighthouse team beginning January 2018. 
Parent Advisory Committee: 
Chairperson: Jessica Scott
Co-Chair:  Julie Hutchinson
Secretary:  Sherr Glenn
Next Parent Group Meeting: 
Parent group meets the 3rd Thursday of the month, at 6:15 PM at the Akers Campus, room D3 
They do not meet in the month of December!
*We would like to remind you we don't offer child care but, we are child friendly*
Upcoming events needing parent volunteers: 
We are always seeking parent volunteers for school events such as school dances, performances, Tricky Tray, Silent Auctions, carnivals, breakfasts and lunches , and field trips.  Parent's are required to attend a volunteer training once, every other year.  Trainings are held at 5:45 prior to the parent group meeting, as well as immediately following coffee and conversation.
Parents can also volunteer to help with on-going committees such as:  Concessions, Restaurants, and Box Tops, Working in the classroom, taking students to visual and performing arts - performances in the area, reading at home, and many more
**If any parent has any special skills or trades that they would like to use for the benefit of the school, this is also a great way to volunteer. 
Please contact the parent group by emailing 
parentgroup@vlcs.org
