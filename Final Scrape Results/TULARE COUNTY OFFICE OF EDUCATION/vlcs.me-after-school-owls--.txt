After-School Owls Program
K through 8th grade students will have the opportunity to participate in the "VLCS After-School Program”.  The program will run Monday through Friday.  
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday  and Friday
3:45 to 5:20 Walnut Campus
2:15pm - 5:20pm Akers Kinder, 3:30-5:20 Akers 1st and 2nd
Thursday
2:00pm - 5:20pm Walnut Campus
1:30pm - 5:20pm Akers Campus
Students must be picked up before 5:30.
Students will be in age-similar groups of 20 or less and participate in structured activities.  First, students will go to the cafeteria where they will check in with their After-School Leader and enjoy a nutritious snack provided by the program.  After snack time, students will "Sharpen the Saw" by participating in an organized physical activity/game.  
The cost per child is $6.00 per day, which also includes a nutritious snack and a bottle of water.  Each monthly session must be paid the first week of the month. Late payments will result in a $10.00 late fee charge added to your total monthly bill. Also, admission to the program may be denied until payment has been made in full. Since we will be holding a spot for your student, no credits and/or refunds for unplanned attendance (absences or early pick up) will be granted. Invoices will be emailed the week before they are due.
In addition to our daily After School Owls Program, sometimes there will be additional enrichment opportunities, clubs, and groups that meet throughout the year. Each month may present new clubs/activities as they become available. Some clubs and groups that have met in the past and may be available this year include:
Showstoppers
Science Club
Minecraft Mondays
Poetry and Prose
Readers Theater
Sign Languagge
Homework Club
