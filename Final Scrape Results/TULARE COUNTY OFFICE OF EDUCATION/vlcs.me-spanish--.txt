Why Spanish?
Leadership is the focus of our school. Multi-lingual leaders have more advantages. Learning Spanish provides a great first step to becoming a multi-lingual leader by teaching students how to learn a second language. Receiving instruction in Spanish reinforces a student's knowledge of English grammar as students need to know the grammatical structures of one language in order to learn them in another language.
According to the State Framework, "Studying a foreign language completes and improves a student's education while providing the foundation for further personal enrichment, scholastic achievement, and economic opportunities."
