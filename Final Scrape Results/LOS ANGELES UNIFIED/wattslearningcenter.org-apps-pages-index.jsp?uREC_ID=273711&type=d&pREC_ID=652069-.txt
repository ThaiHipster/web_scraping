Tell us what you have been up to (Socially, Academically, Accomplishments)?
I hope this email reaches you in good health in mind, body, and spirit. It has been a few years since I last corresponded with you. It has been long road, but the train left the station (Mr. Fisher’s Whistle) and it was full steam ahead. Hunter will be a Senior at Cathedral Preparatory High School in Los Angeles in September. He is on the Honor Roll with a 3.0 GPA and has currently received 32 full scholarship (Football) offers and more inquiries each week from various colleges such as USC, UCLA, University of Washington, University of Oklahoma, Texas A&M, Baylor, Boston College, and Notre Dame.
I would like to thank you for all your dedication and hard work with the Watts Learning Center, without you Hunter would not have had some of the wonderful opportunities as a student there. What didn’t break us, made us stronger. He would love to have you and Mr. Fisher attend one of his games this upcoming Senior season. Thank you again for all that you have done and continue to do. “It takes a Village…” Laronda Echols

Tell us what you have been up to (Socially, Academically, Accomplishments?)
I graduated from Morehouse College in May of 2015. I am currently now working at a recruiting firm where I am Technology Recruiter.
What year did you graduate from the Watts Learning Center?
I graduated from WLC in 2004.
What is the most memorable WLC experience that has had a lasting impact on your life? 
The most memorable moment happened during my fifth grade graduation. I remembered the banner saying Class of 2015, but it was still 2004. During my actual college graduation in May of 2015, I remembered that banner and realized that it was one of the motivating factors which helped me get to that point of my life. 
Based on your experience, what makes the WLC a World Class Institution of Learning? 
Watts Learning Center is a World Class Institution simply because they set out to stand apart from the mundane ways of doing certain things. WLC exposed us to many things that we probably would not have come across if we were at a standard elementary school. 
How would you describe the qualities (ways of thinking, commitments and responsibilities) of a student who graduates from the Watts Learning Center? 
I believe the most important quality of a WLC graduate is the ability to stand apart. I have realized growing up that it is extremely easy to just simply go with the crowd. But being at WLC taught me how to think differently and to think independently. Watts Learning Center taught me to expect excellence in everything that I do, and never settle for anything less.

As of right now, I am currently attending El Camino College in Torrance, California. This will be my last semester at El Camino College, I will be graduating with an Associate Degree for General Arts and Humanities. I will continue my education to receive a Bachelor’s Degree in Sociology. In addition to that I want to obtain a Teaching Credential, to become a high school or elementary teacher. I will be transferring to Cal State University, Dominguez Hills, Fall 2016. While attending college, I have worked as a Tutor for Compton High School and will continue to do so after transferring. 
What year did you graduate from the Watts Learning Center?
I graduated from WLC in 2004.
What is the most memorable WLC experience that has had a lasting impact on your life? 
My most memorable WLC experience that has had a lasting impact on my life was being taught about the history of the Civil Rights Movement in Mr. Mabowe's class. That was the very first time I was introduced to leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Harriet Tubman. 
Based on your experience, what makes the WLC a World Class Institution of Learning? 
Based on my personal experience, WLC is a World Class Institution of Learning because after graduating I was very aware of the importance of having an education. I understood that I am solely responsible for my individual success. Lastly, I ultimately learned that with an education I could have a powerful impact on the impoverished society that I came from. 
How would you describe the qualities (ways of thinking, commitments and responsibilities) of a student who graduates from the Watts Learning Center? 
I believe a WLC graduate possesses resilience, creativity and a competency – They are aware of the magnitude of an education and have a willingness to inspire others.

Tell us what you have been up to (Socially, Academically, Accomplishments)?
As of now, I graduated from View Park Preparatory High School in 2014 with honors. From there, I went to California State University, Dominguez Hills, where I am currently attending for college. Here, I am studying for my Bachelor of Arts in Socio-Psychological Behaviors and African-American Studies and am soon to embark on my final semester at CSUDH, graduating a year early in 2017. On campus, I am very involved and hold different leadership positions, including a seat on the Board of Directors for Associated Students Incorporated where I am the Organizations Commissioner and help oversee 107 on campus clubs and organizations in partnership with the Office of Student Life. I am also a proud member of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity Incorporated, a historical African-American fraternal organization founded on the principles of Brotherhood, Scholarship and Service. I currently work as an Academic Mentor with the Male Success Alliance and mentor youth ranging from ages 12 to 15 years old in schools in Compton, Hawthorne and Gardena. I am currently in the process of studying to obtain a Teaching Credential in hopes of becoming an Elementary school teacher.
What year did you graduate from the Watts Learning Center?
I graduated from Watts Learning Center in 2007.
What is the most memorable WLC experience that has had a lasting impact on your life?
Wow, there are so many to choose from. I think the most memorable WLC experience that has had an impact on my life would definitely be from Mr. Mabowe’s fourth grade class. Mr. Mabowe taught us so much about the importance of education, and hearing it from someone from a country foreign to the U.S. was very inspiring. I especially enjoyed our Cultural Appreciation programs at the school because they were so involved and so intimate and allowed for all students on the campus to really be able to relate to one another and share our stories. Those events have truly had a lasting impact on my life. 
Based on your experience, what makes the WLC a World Class Institution of Learning? 
Based on my experience, the family environment that WLC has makes it a world class institution of learning. From the administrators to the foster grandparents, WLC has a family oriented environment that allows teachers to feel a connection with the students and the students to feel a connection with the school. By establishing this, I think that WLC has allowed a comfortable, safe space environment, to where children can develop and grow into their fullest potential, with the right guidance and passion that the school has to offer. 
How would you describe the qualities (ways of thinking, commitments and responsibilities) of a student who graduates from the Watts Learning Center? 
I can describe these qualities as dedicated. I believe that a student who graduates from Watts Learning Center will be fully dedicated to whatever aspiration they desire. It is from that dedication that accountability and responsibility come to the forefront and students are able to make decisions that will positively impact their life. The school truly continues to live up to its motto: I expect excellence, you expect excellence, and we expect excellence.

Date: November 8, 2016
Tell us what you have been up to (Socially, Academically, Accomplishments)?
I graduated from Middle College High School in 2009. I completed my first 2 years of college while in high school. Upon graduating from high school, I attended UC Berkeley. While at Berkeley, I worked part-time, was the Outreach Coordinator for the Black Retention and Recruitment Center, and I co-directed weekly bible study on campus. I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2011 with my B.A. in Political Science, with a specialization in American Politics. After graduation, I worked as a legal assistant at a law firm in Northern California for 2 years prior to attending law school. 
 I am currently a 2L (second-year student) at Berkeley Law. I serve as the Events Chair for the Law Students of African Descent (LSAD), Finance Chair for the Healthcare and Biotech Law Society (BHBLS), a mentor for the First Generational Professionals (FGP) and a mentor for the Women of Color Collective (WOCC). I am also taking courses to complete my technology and law certificate at Berkeley. After graduation, I will practice Intellectual Property litigation at a large law firm in Northern California. 
What year did you graduate from the Watts Learning Center?
I graduated from WLC in 2003.
What is the most memorable WLC experience that has had a lasting impact on your life?
My most memorable WLC experience was my trip to Africa in 2007. Being able to travel at a young age reinforced the importance of cultural competency, which my mother always instilled in me. My trip also showed me how blessed I am to have the opportunities that I have, which is why I strive to do my best every day.
Based on your experience, what makes the WLC a World Class Institution of Learning? 
The Watts Learning is a World Class Institution because they recruit some of the best educators in California to teach their students. I can honestly say that some of my best educators came from WLC. Additionally, WLC’s love and compassion for their students leave an ever-lasting impact on their lives. The Administration, teachers and staff transcend all expectations to ensure that students are receiving the best education. To illustrate, WLC’s Passport to the World Program, where the school takes students to a different country every 2 years, is one of many ways in which the school goes above and beyond for their students.
How would you describe the qualities (ways of thinking, commitments and responsibilities) of a student who graduates from the Watts Learning Center? 
A student who graduates from WLC leaves being a brilliant leader with a unique future full of possibilities. Students leave with a sense of pride and confidence, which allows them to tackle any academic challenge that they might encounter as they continue throughout their studies.
