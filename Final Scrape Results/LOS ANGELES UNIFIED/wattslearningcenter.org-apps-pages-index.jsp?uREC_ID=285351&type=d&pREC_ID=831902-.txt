The Watts Learning Center (WLC) will be a world-class, child-centered, K-8 institution of learning with strong ties to families and the community
Our Approach
			 Â» Solutions			
Solutions
Solutions
Our children are the solution. We are equipping learners every day with the academic skills and strategies to be prepared to successfully pursue college and careers in the 21st century.
But this is not enough. 
What are the solutions that are needed to solve problems that address international and local conditions that have an adverse effect on the quality of life?
How do we address fundamental issues pertaining to the quality of life in the society?
How do trained professionals study the quality of water in the world and variations across regions? What are they finding? What can be done? What can we do? 
We are striving to create the type of learning experiences for our children to think deeply about the social conditions in the world around them, to evaluate information critically, and to imagine and make positive contributions in the community and society.
