Goals
A fundamental goal is to provide a quality education for every child who attends our schools. Since our founding in 1997, we have tracked student performance. Over time, our best performances include 3rd grade Mathematics, where 87% of children scored proficient/advanced on the California Standards Test in 2007. In 2009, 77% of our 4th grade children scored proficient/advanced on the California Standards Test in Reading.
Based on analysis of our performance over several years in the past, the majority of our children are supported to read and do math on grade level and beyond by the end of the school year.
However, our goal is to ensure that every child is able to read analytically and critically, to develop an informed perspective grounded in evidence, to think and reason, and to evaluate, define and solve problems.
This is our work. In making this happen, we are looking at our curriculums and teaching practices in relationship to evidence of learning and learner progress and the learning outcomes we envision for every child at the WLC.
The goal to prepare every child from the Watts Learning Center or colleges and careers means that our students need to be supported and engaged in active learning experiences over time in order to:
