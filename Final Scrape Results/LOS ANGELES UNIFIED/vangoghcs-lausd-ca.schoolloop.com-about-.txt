ABOUT
Van Gogh Charter is located across the street from Bee Canyon Park, in a quiet Granada Hills neighborhood. 
Initially opened in 1968, much of the Van Gogh campus was rebuilt after the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. The TK-5th elementary school is on a traditional one-track school calendar.
California Distinguished School
Van Gogh Charter was  awarded California Distinguished School Status on April 15, 2008.
