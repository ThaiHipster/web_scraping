Commitments
At the Watts Learning Center, we share a number of commitments. Principally, we are committed to bringing excellence into the lives of children. We are committed to providing opportunities for children to excel and to making a positive difference in the lives of children.
At the basis of our work is a moral commitment to basic principles of democracy and social justice to improve the quality of life and conditions in the society by facilitating meaningful and productive learning experiences for our children.
As a community of learners, we are engaged in continuous learning and thinking to re-examine, articulate and represent our commitments as a basis for our work and why we are here.
We regularly engage in thinking and discussion about our commitments, what they are based upon and how they guide our work.   These commitment areas include the following:
