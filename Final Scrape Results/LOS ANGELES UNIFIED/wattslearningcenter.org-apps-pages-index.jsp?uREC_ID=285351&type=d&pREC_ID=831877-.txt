Perspective on Learning
Perspective on Learning
At the basis of a systematic approach to teaching is a shared theoretical perspective and grounding on learning. The learning sciences research (2000) confirmed that: 
All learning is based upon previous learning; 
Learning is understanding disciplinary concepts, explaining relationships among them, and knowing how to use this knowledge for authentic purposes; 
Knowledge taught in a variety of contexts supports flexible transfer

Building upon these understandings, we are engaged in dialogue to clarify our perspective about how learning is facilitated. More specifically, we are interested in knowing how and under which conditions our students learn.
Our conversations help to clarify our perspective. Clarifying our stance on the role that children play in the learning process is fundamental to our ongoing inquiry.
In the past, our schools determined that learning occurs primarily through exposure and experience.
