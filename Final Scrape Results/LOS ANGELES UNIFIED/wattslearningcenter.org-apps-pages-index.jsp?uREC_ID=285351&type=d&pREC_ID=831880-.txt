Core Practices
Core Practices
Fundamental to a shared approach to teaching is a set of core instructional practices.
A goal across our schools is to develop, describe and use a shared set of effective instructional practices among teachers consistent with our core values and perspective on learning.
As opposed to replication of ‘best practices’ without true understanding in context, our staff are in the process of engaging in genuine professional inquiry and dialogue to document and describe the effectiveness of teaching practices in relationship to learner responses to instruction.
These conversations will lead over time to the articulation, explanation and representation of shared instructional practices in our schools to improve the quality, consistency and predictability of learning for every child.
