Philosophy
According to Dr. Etta R. Hollins (2011), 
“Philosophical perspective refers to the vision and purpose for education and its relationship to conditions in the larger society and how it benefits individuals and groups. In practice, a philosophical stance is the conscious thought process through which a deliberately constructed system of beliefs is operationalized. The central purpose for the deliberately constructed philosophical stance is to develop deep personal meaning, a sense of responsibility, and a commitment to developing teaching practices that contribute to academic and social growth and awareness of students as part of a collective effort to improve the quality of life in society in a particular way” (p. 400).

What is our philosophical stance and what is it based upon?
At the Watts Learning Center, we are engaged in continuous dialogue, analysis and thinking to re-construct, articulate and represent a shared perspective to guide our practice to advance learning for every child.
Presently, our philosophy includes some of the following perspectives:
✦
 Every child must be known, understood and respected because children are at the center of the educational process. 
✦
 Parental involvement and volunteer services support and enhance the teaching and learning process. 
✦
 Children play an active role in the learning process
✦
 Educational experiences should enable students to communicate effectively, solve problems competently, think critically and creatively, and act responsibly.
