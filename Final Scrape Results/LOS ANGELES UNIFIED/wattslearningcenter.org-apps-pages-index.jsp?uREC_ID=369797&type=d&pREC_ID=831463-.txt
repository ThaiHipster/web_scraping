Welcome
We are proud to offer a "World-class Education" in the inner-city of Watts, for the heart of our community, our children, with the sole purpose of inspiring them to see their full academic potential, and cultivating within them a culture of love for learning.
We focus on creating an environment where our students seek to be high academic achievers. We build our students with confidence and endurance, teaching and encouraging strong work habits towards as they strive for their dreams. We encourage them to be lifelong learners. We cultivate a system of ethics around them so they will become role models and leadersin their communities and among their peers. 
We cater to educating the whole student -fostering mindful academic curriculum and content; urging critical thinking and problem-solving skills; encouraging respectful peer to peer, friend and adult relationships. Through academia, athletics, and extracurricular activity we provide a model of education that develops the student holistically, with a
 voice to stand for what is right towards growing positive and progressive neighborhoods.
