All - Stars After School Program
Simon Technology has partnered with All-Stars to provide a free after school program for all interested students. All-Stars provides tutoring, dance, sports, and extra curricular activities during after school hours. The program starts right after-school and ends at 5:30 pm. The program begins with providing snacks to all students followed by a structured schedule after school. Students have the opportunity to participate in sports or an extracurricular class of their choice. Currently, All-Stars offers cheer/dance, cosmetology, physical fitness, community service, art, fashion, music and other activities after school.  If you are interested in learning more about our after-school program, please contact All-Stars Program Coordinator, at 
simon@la-allstars.org
. Applications are also available in the main office or visit Ms. Saldana in her office (second-floor). 
Monday 1:50 pm - 4:30 pm
