The Watts Learning Center (WLC) will be a world-class, child-centered, K-8 institution of learning with strong ties to families and the community
Our Approach
			 Â» Interaction			
Interaction
Interaction
We are concerned with the quality of interactions our children are engaging in on a daily basis. The quality of dialogue and interaction with peers and our staff form particular patterns of reasoning, habits and conceptualizations of self and others.
The Watts Learning Center Way is based on the premise that every child in our schools must be known and understood, valued and respected as an independent thinking person.
 This understanding is the starting point for interactions based upon respect that is mutual.
