The Watts Learning Center (WLC) will be a world-class, child-centered, K-8 institution of learning with strong ties to families and the community
Our Approach
			 Â» WLC Curriculum			
WLC Curriculum
WLC Curriculum
Our curriculums define the work to be each year to advance a particular type of learning experience in accordance with the Watts Learning Center Way and the vision we have for learning and for our graduates.
In our schools, we are engaging in the process of making our curriculums. This requires a commitment to thinking deeply, collaboratively, and to planning more strategically and intentionally in order to ensure that particular concepts are understood, core experiences are planned and sequenced, central questions are engaged thoughtfully, and fundamental problems and solutions are explored and developed among our staff and students in an integrated way with continuity across grades K-8. 
The curriculum represents the plan to ensure that every child who attends our schools graduates with a set of common experiences, understandings, thought patterns, perspectives and commitments consistent with our vision for learning and learners.
