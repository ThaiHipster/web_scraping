Van Gogh Annual Calendar
A HUGE THANK YOU !
Van Gogh expresses a HUGE THANKS to:
The Patriot Oil Community Benefit Trust Fund for 
providing Kadima Conservatory Scholarships and their continued support  for our computer lab and our technological needs.
The Granada Hills North Neighborhood Council for their generous contribution for library books and physical education equipment!
Councilman Mitch Englander's office for his generous contribution to our school.  Funds will support our students in a variety of ways.
Calling All Volunteers!!!
Our school needs YOUR HELP! Volunteers are needed for our MORNING DROP-OFF VALET.  Student safety is a priority, and the more support we have, the safer our students will be.  Please see the main office to help.
Fall Festival
A huge thank you to all of the incredible volunteers that made our Fall Festival amazing!!!
LOST AND FOUND
Please label your student's jackets, backpacks, and lunch boxes with their name.  This will help ensure that lost items may be found.  Our collection of unclaimed items grows rapidly and is donated to charity at the end of each month.
Peanut Policy
Please support us......Due to students with severe peanut allergies, we request that snacks and lunches stay PEANUT FREE! 
We would appreciate your support in avoiding sending foods that contain peanuts or any other form of tree nuts, such as sandwich crackers filled with peanut butter, granola bars, and trail mix.
Some healthy & nutritional 
alternatives
 include: ham, roast beef, tuna, egg salad, cream cheese and jelly sandwiches, hard-boiled eggs, fruit salad, yogurt & fruit, fruit rollups, apples with caramel, hummus, celery & carrot sticks, animal crackers, popcorn, pudding or Jell-o, and Rice Krispie Treats. Thank you for your cooperation!
WEEKLY ANNOUNCEMENTS
Good Evening Van Gogh Staff and Families,
          It was great to see some of our families this weekend giving their time to the YMCA to make Thanksgiving baskets for families in need.  A special thank you to all of the volunteers that made our movie day so successful!!! This week our valet volunteers are from Ms. Selman's class.   Please help us keep our students safe at drop off by volunteering 15 minutes in the morning.  We have just finished our first reporting period and now it's important to set new goals.  Please keep in mind that attendance directly impacts student learning.  Our goal is that no child is absent more than 7 days each school year.  Being on time is important too.  Three tardies is = to 1 absence.  We are moving towards a more closed campus to ensure the safety of our students and staff.  Please refrain from entering classrooms  in the morning unless you are the designated Breakfast in the Classroom volunteer.  We ask that all parents leave campus as soon as the 8:01 bell has rung.  All parents that remain on campus should have signed in and be wearing a visitor or volunteer pass.  Our Standing Committees and our School wide Positive Behavior Intervention Support Committee (SWPBIS)  will meet on Tuesday, Nov. 14th at 1:40 p.m.  Parents join us on Thursday, 11/16 for  a GATE meeting at 6:00 p.m. in the library.  Please send in your school experience survey or your online confirmation of completion by Wednesday, 11/15.  All students that turn them in will be entered into a raffle for lunch with the Principal. On Friday, Dec. 17th there will be a PTO meeting at 8:15 a.m. in the Parent Center.   Our Holiday Boutique is just around the corner.  Students will preview the items on Monday, 11/27 and the boutique will be open for business until Friday, Dec. 1st.  There is always so much going on here at Van Gogh!! I look forward to seeing you at tomorrow morning's assembly.
Sincerely,
Ms. Merloni
