Watts Learning Center K-8
A Learning Forum Series: Agents of Social change
Learner-Driven Inquiry, Investigation, Research
Learning Forums bring together our children and families, teachers and staff, and community across both schools to engage in dialogue with our children about their learning.
This process will be a Celebration of Substantive Learning across our schools. The celebration will result in the following: 
Identification of grade level representative examples of substantive student learning for celebration, study, dialogue and display in our schools
Articulation of a shared definition and description of internal standards of excellence in learning as a K-8 Institution. 
Definition of a collaborative review process to examine and identify representations of student learning that meet internally defined criteria for public presentation and dialogue across K-8 schools, families and community 
 A Learning Forum Series: Social Change Agents
What questions are the children asking about our community as the basis for learning?
Children and learning are at the center of social change and progress in the community. At the Watts Learning Center (WLC), we are committed to improving the conditions in the community through the quality and substance of learning that takes place every day in our schools.  Our schools showcase student research teams across grades levels, culminating at the Watts Labor Community Action Committee (WLCAC) before a Community Panel.
Our children are engaged in inquiry, investigation and research to define and solve real problems that impact the
local community and world. WLC created A Learning Forum Series: Agents of Social Change to provide our children with the experience of conducting authentic research and presenting their learning to families and the community.
At the WLC, every child is known, valued and respected as an independent thinking person. The learning process at the WLC fosters particular habits of mind and responsibilities among the children for civic engagement, collaboration, and leadership. Learning in our schools develops agency among children to define and solve real problems as citizens committed to the advancement of society.
WLC graduates are self-confident, ethical and motivated to be lifelong learners.
