Compliance with SB 1375 Title IX.
1
California Department of Education
Nondiscrimination Statement
The State of California, Department of Education (CDE), is committed to ensuring equal, fair, and
meaningful access to employment and education services. The CDE does not discriminate in any
employment practice, education program, or educational activity on the basis and/or association with a
person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics of age, ancestry, color,
disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity or expression, genetic information, marital status, medical
condition, national origin, political affiliation, pregnancy and related conditions, race, religion, retaliation,
sex (including sexual harassment), sexual orientation, Vietnam Era Veterans’ status, or any other basis
prohibited by California state and federal nondiscrimination laws respectively. Not all bases of
discrimination will apply to both education services and employment. The Office of Equal Opportunity is
charged with overseeing, leading, and directing the CDE’s efforts to meet the legal obligations set forth in
state and federal civil rights laws, and regulations in CDE employment and delivery of education services.
Inquiries regarding nondiscrimination and civil rights should be directed to the Office of Equal
Opportunity.
Title IX
Title IX is a federal law that was passed in 1972 to ensure that male and female students and employees in
educational settings are treated equally and fairly. It protects against discrimination based on sex
(including sexual harassment). In addition, Title IX protects transgender students and students who do not
conform to gender stereotypes. State law also prohibits discrimination based on gender (sex), gender
expression, gender identity, and sexual orientation. The preamble to Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972 states that:
“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the
benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal
financial assistance.”
Title IX requires that each school district have at least one person designated as the Title IX Coordinator.
Gender Equity
It is the policy of the State of California that all persons, regardless of their gender, should enjoy freedom
from discrimination of any kind in the educational institution of the state. The laws found in the
California Education Code 221.5-231.5 are collectively known as the Sex Equity in Education Act. These
laws expand upon gender equity and Title IX laws which provide guidance to California’s education
system.

The rights of a pupil and the public and the responsibilities of the public school, private school, school
district, county office of education, or charter school under Title IX.
WLC has the primary responsibility to insure compliance with applicable state and federal laws and
regulations and has established procedures to address allegations of unlawful discrimination, harassment,
intimidation, and bullying, and complaints alleging violations of state or federal laws governing educational
programs and the charging of unlawful pupil fees. WLC shall investigate and seek to resolve complaints
using policies and procedures known as the Uniform Complaint Procedure (“UCP”) adopted by our local
board.
1. Complaints alleging discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying, must be filed using the
Uniform Complaint Procedure Form (located in the Parent/Student Handbook and Main Office)
with the Compliance Officer (the Executive Director) within six (6) months from the date the
alleged discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying, occurred or the date the complainant
first obtained knowledge of the facts of the alleged discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or
bullying, unless the time for filing is extended by the Executive Director or his or her designee. (A
complete copy of the school’s UCP policy and complaint procedures is available free of charge in
the main office.)
2. Complaints will be investigated and a written Decision or report will be sent to the complainant
within sixty (60) days from the receipt of the complaint. The complainant has a right to appeal the
School’s Decision to the California Department of Education (CDE) by filing a written appeal.
Civil law remedies may be available under state or federal discrimination, harassment, intimidation,
or bullying laws, if applicable.
POLICY AGAINST UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT
WLC Charter School is committed to providing a work and educational atmosphere that is free of unlawful
harassment. WLC policy prohibits sexual harassment and harassment based upon pregnancy, childbirth or
related medical conditions, race, religion, creed, color, gender, gender identity, gender expression, national
origin or ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, marital status, age, sexual orientation,
or any other basis protected by federal, state, local law, ordinance or regulation. WLC will not condone or
tolerate harassment of any type by any employee, independent contractor or other person with which WLC
does business, or any other individual, student or volunteer. This policy applies to all employee, student or
volunteer actions and relationships, regardless of position or gender. WLC will promptly and thoroughly
investigate any complaint of harassment and take appropriate corrective action, if warranted.
WLC is committed to provide a workplace and educational environment free of sexual harassment and
considers such harassment to be a major offense, which may result in disciplinary action, up to, and
including dismissal, of the offending employee, and disciplinary action up to and including suspension
and/or expulsion for students.
1. It is also unlawful to retaliate in any way against an employee who has articulated a good faith
concern about sexual harassment against him or her against another individual.
2. All supervisors of staff will receive sexual harassment training within six (6) months of their
assumption of a supervisory position and will receive further training once every two (2) years
thereafter. All staff will receive sexual harassment training and/or instruction concerning sexual
harassment in the workplace as required by law.
Watts Learning Center
Compliance with SB 1375 Title IX.

3. Each employee, volunteer and student has the responsibility to maintain a workplace and
educational environment free from any form of sexual harassment. Consequently, should any
individual, in particular those with supervisory responsibilities, become aware of any conduct that
may constitute sexual harassment or other prohibited behavior, immediate action should be taken
to address such conduct. Employees and students are expected to act in a positive and professional
manner and to contribute to a productive school environment that is free from harassing or
disruptive activity.
4. Any employee who believes they have been harassed or has witnessed harassment is encouraged
to immediately report such harassment to the Compliance Officer (Executive Director) and
complete the “Harassment Complaint Form.”
5. The Executive Director shall ensure that employees designated to investigate complaints are
knowledgeable about the laws and programs for which they are responsible.
6. Complainants and witnesses under these policies will be protected from further harassment and will
not be retaliated against in any aspect of their employment due to their participation, filing of a
complaint or reporting sexual harassment. WLC will investigate complaints promptly and provide
a written report of the investigation and decision as soon as practicable. The investigation will be
handled in as confidential a manner as possible consistent with a full, fair, and proper investigation.
7. While in most situations a personal relationship is a private matter, these relationships are not
appropriate in a professional setting, particularly where one of the parties has management or
supervisory responsibilities.

A description of how to file a complaint under Title IX.
An explanation of the statute of limitations within which a complaint must be filed after an alleged
incident of discrimination has occurred, and how a complaint may be filed beyond the statute of
limitations.
The Board of Directors for Watts Learning Center Elementary and Watts Learning Center Charter Middle
School (herein after collectively referred to as “Charter School”) policy is to comply with applicable federal
and state laws and regulations. The Charter School is the local agency primarily responsible for compliance
with federal and state laws and regulations governing educational programs. Pursuant to this policy, persons
responsible for conducting investigations shall be knowledgeable about the laws and programs which they
are assigned to investigate. This complaint procedure is adopted to provide a uniform system of complaint
processing for the following types of complaints: Complaints of unlawful discrimination, harassment,
intimidation or bullying against any protected group, including actual or perceived discrimination, on the
basis of the actual or perceived characteristics of age, ancestry, color, disability, ethnic group identification,
gender expression, gender identity, gender, genetic information, nationality, national origin, race or

Compliance with SB 1375 Title IX.
5
ethnicity, religion, sex, or sexual orientation, or on the basis of a person’s association with a person or group
with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics in any Charter School program or activity.
The Charter School acknowledges and respects every individual’s rights to privacy. Unlawful
discrimination, harassment, intimidation or bullying complaints shall be investigated in a manner that
protects [to the greatest extent reasonably possible] the confidentiality of the parties and the integrity of the
process. The Charter School cannot guarantee anonymity of the complainant. This includes keeping the
identity of the complainant confidential. However, the Charter School will attempt to do so as appropriate.
The Charter School may find it necessary to disclose information regarding the complaint/complainant to
the extent necessary to carry out the investigation or proceedings, as determined by the Director or designee
on a case-by-case basis.
The Charter School prohibits any form of retaliation against any complainant in the complaint process,
including but not limited to a complainant’s filing of a complaint or the reporting of instances of unlawful
discrimination, harassment, intimidation or bullying. Such participation shall not in any way affect the
status, grades or work assignments of the complainant.
Compliance Officers
The Board of Directors designates the following compliance officer(s) and/or the compliance officer’s
designee to receive and investigate complaints and to ensure the Charter School’s compliance with law:
Jared Lancer, Executive Director
Watts Learning Center
310 W. 95th St.
Los Angeles, CA 90003
(323) 754-9900
jlancer@wlccms.org
The Executive Director or designee shall ensure that employees designated to investigate complaints are
knowledgeable about the laws and programs for which they are responsible. Designated employees may
have access to legal counsel as determined by the Director or designee.
Should a complaint be filed against the Executive Director, the compliance officer for that case shall be the
President of the Charter School Board of Directors.
Procedures
The following procedures shall be used to address all complaints which allege that the Charter School has
violated federal or state laws or regulations governing educational programs. Compliance officers shall
maintain a record of each complaint and subsequent related actions.
All parties involved in allegations shall be notified when a complaint is filed, when a complaint meeting or
hearing is scheduled, and when a decision or ruling is made.
 Step 1: Filing of Complaint
Any individual, public agency, or organization may file a written complaint of alleged
noncompliance by the Charter School.
A complaint alleging unlawful discrimination, harassment, intimidation or bullying shall be
initiated no later than six (6) months from the date when the alleged unlawful discrimination,
harassment, intimidation or bullying occurred, or six (6) months from the date when the
complainant first obtained knowledge of the facts of the alleged unlawful discrimination,
Watts Learning Center
Compliance with SB 1375 Title IX.

harassment, intimidation or bullying. A complaint may be filed by a person who alleges that he/she
personally suffered unlawful discrimination, harassment, intimidation or bullying or by a person
who believes that an individual or any specific class of individuals has been subjected to unlawful
discrimination, harassment, intimidation or bullying. A 90-day extension can be granted by the
Executive Director or designee for filing a complaint after the statute of limitations.
The complaint shall be presented to the compliance officer or designee who shall maintain a log of
complaints received, providing each with a code number and date stamp.
If a complainant is unable to put a complaint in writing due to conditions such as a disability or
illiteracy, the Charter School staff shall assist him/her in the filing of the complaint. A form can
be completed and submitted as part of the Uniform Complaint Policy.
 Step 2: Mediation
Within three (3) days of receiving the complaint, the compliance officer or designee may informally
discuss with the complainant the possibility of using mediation. If the complainant agrees to
mediation, the compliance officer shall make arrangements for this process.
Before initiating the mediation of an unlawful discrimination, harassment, intimidation or bullying
complaint, the compliance officer shall ensure that all parties agree to make the mediator a party to
related confidential information.
If the mediation process does not resolve the problem within the parameters of law, the compliance
officer shall proceed with his/her investigation of the complaint.
The use of mediation shall not extend the Charter School’s timelines for investigating and resolving
the complaint unless the complainant agrees in writing to such an extension of time.
 Step 3: Investigation of Complaint
The compliance officer or designee is encouraged to hold an investigative meeting within five (5)
days of receiving the complaint or an unsuccessful attempt to mediate the complaint. This meeting
shall provide an opportunity for the complainant and/or his/her representative to repeat the
complaint orally.
The complainant and/or his/her representative shall have an opportunity to present the complaint
and evidence or information leading to evidence to support the allegations in the complaint.
A complainant’s refusal to provide the Charter School’s investigator with documents or other
evidence related to the allegations in the complaint, or his/her failure or refusal to cooperate in the
investigation or his/her engagement in any other obstruction of the investigation, may result in the
dismissal of the complaint because of a lack of evidence to support the allegation.
The Charter School’s refusal to provide the investigator with access to records and/or other
information related to the allegation in the complaint, or its failure or refusal to cooperate in the
investigation or its engagement in any other obstruction of the investigation, may result in a finding,
based on evidence collected, that a violation has occurred and may result in the imposition of a
remedy in favor of the complainant.

 Step 4: Response
Unless extended by written agreement with the complainant, the compliance officer or designee
shall prepare and send to the complainant a written report of the Charter School’s investigation and
decision, as described in Step #5 below, within sixty (60) days of the Charter School’s receipt of
the complaint.
 Step 5: Final Written Decision
The Charter School’s decision shall be in writing and sent to the complainant. The Charter School’s
decision shall be written in English and in the language of the complainant whenever feasible or as
required by law.
The decision shall include:
1. The findings of fact based on evidence gathered.
2. The conclusion(s) of law.
3. Disposition of the complaint.
4. Rationale for such disposition.
5. Corrective actions, if any are warranted.
6. Notice of the complainant’s right to appeal the Charter School’s decision within fifteen
(15) days to the CDE and procedures to be followed for initiating such an appeal.
7. For unlawful discrimination, harassment, intimidation or bullying complaints arising under
state law, notice that the complainant must wait until sixty (60) days have elapsed from the
filing of an appeal with the CDE before pursuing civil law remedies.
8. For unlawful discrimination, harassment, intimidation or bullying complaints arising under
federal law such complaint may be made at any time to the U.S. Department of Education,
Office for Civil Rights.
If an employee is disciplined as a result of the complaint, the decision shall simply state that
effective action was taken and that the employee was informed of the Charter School’s
expectations. The report shall not give any further information as to the nature of the disciplinary
action.
Appeals to the California Department of Education
If dissatisfied with the Charter School’s decision, the complainant may appeal in writing to the CDE within
fifteen (15) days of receiving the Charter School’s decision. When appealing to the CDE, the complainant
must specify the basis for the appeal of the decision and whether the facts are incorrect and/or the law has
been misapplied. The appeal shall be accompanied by a copy of the locally filed complaint and a copy of
the Charter School’s decision.
Upon notification by the CDE that the complainant has appealed the Charter School’s decision, the Director
or designee shall forward the following documents to the CDE:
Watts Learning Center
Compliance with SB 1375 Title IX.
8
1. A copy of the original complaint.
2. A copy of the decision.
3. A summary of the nature and extent of the investigation conducted by the Charter School, if not
covered by the decision.
4. A copy of the investigation file, including but not limited to all notes, interviews, and documents
submitted by all parties and gathered by the investigator.
5. A report of any action taken to resolve the complaint.
6. A copy of the Charter School’s complaint procedures.
7. Other relevant information requested by the CDE.
The CDE may directly intervene in the complaint without waiting for action by the Charter School when
one of the conditions listed in Title 5, California Code of Regulations, Section 4650 exists, including cases
in which the Charter School has not taken action within sixty (60) days of the date the complaint was filed
with the Charter School.
Civil Law Remedies
A complainant may pursue available civil law remedies outside of the Charter School’s complaint
procedures. Complainants may seek assistance from mediation centers or public/private interest attorneys.
Civil law remedies that may be imposed by a court include, but are not limited to, injunctions and restraining
orders. For unlawful discrimination, harassment, intimidation or bullying complaints arising under state
law, however, a complainant must wait until sixty (60) days have elapsed from the filing of an appeal with
the CDE before pursuing civil law remedies. The moratorium does not apply to injunctive relief and is
applicable only if the Charter School has appropriately, and in a timely manner, apprised the complainant
of his/her right to file a complaint in accordance with 5 CCR 4622.
An explanation of how the complaint will be investigated and how the complainant may further pursue
the complaint, including, but not limited to, Internet Web links to this information on the United States
Department of Education Office for Civil Rights’ Internet website.
The following procedures shall be used to address all complaints which allege that the Charter School has
violated federal or state laws or regulations governing educational programs. Compliance officers shall
maintain a record of each complaint and subsequent related actions.
All parties involved in allegations shall be notified when a complaint is filed, when a complaint meeting or
hearing is scheduled, and when a decision or ruling is made.
 Step 1: Filing of Complaint
Any individual, public agency, or organization may file a written complaint of alleged
noncompliance by the Charter School.
A complaint alleging unlawful discrimination, harassment, intimidation or bullying shall be
initiated no later than six (6) months from the date when the alleged unlawful discrimination,
harassment, intimidation or bullying occurred, or six (6) months from the date when the

complainant first obtained knowledge of the facts of the alleged unlawful discrimination,
harassment, intimidation or bullying. A complaint may be filed by a person who alleges that he/she
personally suffered unlawful discrimination, harassment, intimidation or bullying or by a person
who believes that an individual or any specific class of individuals has been subjected to unlawful
discrimination, harassment, intimidation or bullying. A 90-day extension can be granted by the
Executive Director or designee for filing a complaint after the statute of limitations.
The complaint shall be presented to the compliance officer or designee who shall maintain a log of
complaints received, providing each with a code number and date stamp.
If a complainant is unable to put a complaint in writing due to conditions such as a disability or
illiteracy, the Charter School staff shall assist him/her in the filing of the complaint. A form can
be completed and submitted as part of the Uniform Complaint Policy.
 Step 2: Mediation
Within three (3) days of receiving the complaint, the compliance officer or designee may informally
discuss with the complainant the possibility of using mediation. If the complainant agrees to
mediation, the compliance officer shall make arrangements for this process.
Before initiating the mediation of an unlawful discrimination, harassment, intimidation or bullying
complaint, the compliance officer shall ensure that all parties agree to make the mediator a party to
related confidential information.
If the mediation process does not resolve the problem within the parameters of law, the compliance
officer shall proceed with his/her investigation of the complaint.
The use of mediation shall not extend the Charter School’s timelines for investigating and resolving
the complaint unless the complainant agrees in writing to such an extension of time.
 Step 3: Investigation of Complaint
The compliance officer or designee is encouraged to hold an investigative meeting within five (5)
days of receiving the complaint or an unsuccessful attempt to mediate the complaint. This meeting
shall provide an opportunity for the complainant and/or his/her representative to repeat the
complaint orally.
The complainant and/or his/her representative shall have an opportunity to present the complaint
and evidence or information leading to evidence to support the allegations in the complaint.
A complainant’s refusal to provide the Charter School’s investigator with documents or other
evidence related to the allegations in the complaint, or his/her failure or refusal to cooperate in the
investigation or his/her engagement in any other obstruction of the investigation, may result in the
dismissal of the complaint because of a lack of evidence to support the allegation.
The Charter School’s refusal to provide the investigator with access to records and/or other
information related to the allegation in the complaint, or its failure or refusal to cooperate in the
investigation or its engagement in any other obstruction of the investigation, may result in a finding,
based on evidence collected, that a violation has occurred and may result in the imposition of a
remedy in favor of the complainant.

 Step 4: Response
Unless extended by written agreement with the complainant, the compliance officer or designee
shall prepare and send to the complainant a written report of the Charter School’s investigation and
decision, as described in Step #5 below, within sixty (60) days of the Charter School’s receipt of
the complaint.
 Step 5: Final Written Decision
The Charter School’s decision shall be in writing and sent to the complainant. The Charter School’s
decision shall be written in English and in the language of the complainant whenever feasible or as
required by law.
The decision shall include:
1. The findings of fact based on evidence gathered.
2. The conclusion(s) of law.
3. Disposition of the complaint.
4. Rationale for such disposition.
5. Corrective actions, if any are warranted.
6. Notice of the complainant’s right to appeal the Charter School’s decision within fifteen (15)
days to the CDE and procedures to be followed for initiating such an appeal.
7. For unlawful discrimination, harassment, intimidation or bullying complaints arising under
state law, notice that the complainant must wait until sixty (60) days have elapsed from the
filing of an appeal with the CDE before pursuing civil law remedies.
8. For unlawful discrimination, harassment, intimidation or bullying complaints arising under
federal law such complaint may be made at any time to the U.S. Department of Education,
Office for Civil Rights.
If an employee is disciplined as a result of the complaint, the decision shall simply state that
effective action was taken and that the employee was informed of the Charter School’s
expectations. The report shall not give any further information as to the nature of the disciplinary
action.
Appeals to the California Department of Education
If dissatisfied with the Charter School’s decision, the complainant may appeal in writing to the CDE within
fifteen (15) days of receiving the Charter School’s decision. When appealing to the CDE, the complainant
must specify the basis for the appeal of the decision and whether the facts are incorrect and/or the law has
been misapplied. The appeal shall be accompanied by a copy of the locally filed complaint and a copy of
the Charter School’s decision.

11
Upon notification by the CDE that the complainant has appealed the Charter School’s decision, the Director
or designee shall forward the following documents to the CDE:
1. A copy of the original complaint.
2. A copy of the decision.
3. A summary of the nature and extent of the investigation conducted by the Charter School, if not
covered by the decision.
4. A copy of the investigation file, including but not limited to all notes, interviews, and documents
submitted by all parties and gathered by the investigator.
5. A report of any action taken to resolve the complaint.
6. A copy of the Charter School’s complaint procedures.
7. Other relevant information requested by the CDE.
The CDE may directly intervene in the complaint without waiting for action by the Charter School when
one of the conditions listed in Title 5, California Code of Regulations, Section 4650 exists, including cases
in which the Charter School has not taken action within sixty (60) days of the date the complaint was filed
with the Charter School.
Civil Law Remedies
A complainant may pursue available civil law remedies outside of the Charter School’s complaint
procedures. Complainants may seek assistance from mediation centers or public/private interest attorneys.
Civil law remedies that may be imposed by a court include, but are not limited to, injunctions and restraining
orders. For unlawful discrimination, harassment, intimidation or bullying complaints arising under state
law, however, a complainant must wait until sixty (60) days have elapsed from the filing of an appeal with
the CDE before pursuing civil law remedies. The moratorium does not apply to injunctive relief and is
applicable only if the Charter School has appropriately, and in a timely manner, apprised the complainant
of his/her right to file a complaint in accordance with 5 CCR 4622.
