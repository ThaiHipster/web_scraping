Friends of Van Gogh    
Friends of Van Gogh is our school's PTO (Parent Teacher Organization).  Much of our school's success is due in part to our PTO, which organizes fundraisers through events like Fall Festival, Carnival, dine-out nights- all to provide educational enrichment for our students.  Through Friends of Van Gogh, our students are able to participate in Physical Education, the school computer lab, and the "Meet the Masters" art program.
