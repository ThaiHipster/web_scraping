Principal's Message AUG. 2017
Dear Parents, Students, Teachers, and Staff,
         Welcome to our 2017-2018 School Year!!!!!!!!! We have all been very busy at Van Gogh Charter preparing for your return.  I am so excited to see all of you on Tuesday, August 15th!!!  The first bell will ring at 7:56 a.m. and dismissal will be at 1:20 p.m.  The first week will be a busy time for all of us adjusting to our new routines.  Be sure to allow yourself enough time to get enough sleep and arrive to school before the bell rings.  This year we welcome many new additions to our Van Gogh Staff:  Kindergarten Teacher,
Ms. Guzelian,  Assistant Principal, Behnaz Valamehr, Speech/Language Teacher, Elizabeth Beizai, Dance Teacher, Lia Sweeney, and our new Teacher Assistants:  Frances Zumbro, Shamere Riggins, Asha Alwani, Victoria Stifano, Claire Vencill, Eliza Zendejas, and Adela Robins.  We will also welcome back Physical Education Teacher, Mr. Alevras who will be with us one day a week.  Along with all of our wonderful, committed teachers and staff we are ready to make this a spectacular year!  We are all part of the Van Gogh Team!  Together we are an unbelievable force! I am looking forward to working with each of you to achieve the highest expectations for our students academically, creatively, physically, emotionally, and socially!   
Sincerely,
Ms. Merloni
