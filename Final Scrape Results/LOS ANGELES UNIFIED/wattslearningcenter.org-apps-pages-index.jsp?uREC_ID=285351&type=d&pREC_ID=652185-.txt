The Watts Learning Center Way
The Watts Learning Center Way
What is the meaning of a World Class Education?
Our staff is engaged in continuous thinking and learning to reimagine and re-think education. We are engaged in understanding the meaning of a World Class Education. Based on this understanding, we are engaged in the process of making the ‘Watts Learning Center Way.’ 
Fundamental to the Watts Learning Center Way is the basic premise that every child in our schools is known and understood, valued and respected as an independent thinking person.
