Impact & Evidence
A fundamental goal is to provide a quality education for every child who attends our schools. Since our founding in 1997, we have tracked student performance. Over time, our best performances include 3rd grade Mathematics, where 87% of children scored proficient/advanced on the California Standards Test in 2007. In 2009, 77% of our 4th grade children scored proficient/advanced on the California Standards Test in Reading.
Based on analysis of our performance over several years in the past, the majority of our children are supported to read and do math on grade level and beyond by the end of the school year. However, our goal is to ensure that every child is able to read analytically and critically, to develop an informed perspective grounded in evidence, to think and reason, and to evaluate, define and solve problems.
We know we have done our work the right way when our students come back to let us know that they have enrolled in and graduated from college. These stories collectively represent our impact and tradition over time of excellence.
Our students have graduated from Morehouse College, UC Berkeley, University of Wisconsin at Madison and many other colleges and universities.
Below is a listing of some of our graduates:
