Professional Development School
“Strength is derived from unity. The range of our collective vision is far greater when individual insights become one.” – Andrew Carnegie, philanthropist
Tapestry Charter School is a Professional Development School. Tapestry Charter High School and Canisius College recognize that the strength of the Buffalo community lies in the relationships that develop among those institutions that are invested in our city. Put simply, children benefit when adults understand and practice a positive interdependence.
Tapestry Charter School and 
Canisius College
 School of Education and Human Services have developed a formal partnership with this mission: “to develop a relationship between Tapestry Charter School and Canisius College that will enhance the child/student educational experience, provide opportunities for growth, and increase the likelihood of success through a sharing of respective resources.”
Canisius College will support Tapestry Charter High School in the following areas: instruction and mentoring of Tapestry students, assistance with sports and wellness programming, summer and after-school student programs, staff development programs, and use of the physical facilities of Canisius College.
Tapestry Charter High School will provide Canisius College with a site for educational research and with field experiences for teaching, counseling, and administrative candidates.
