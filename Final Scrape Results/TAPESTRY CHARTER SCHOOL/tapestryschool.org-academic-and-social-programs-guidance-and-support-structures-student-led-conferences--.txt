Student-Led Conferences & Portfolios
Student-Led Conferences
At the conclusion of each trimester, Student Led Conferences are held among the student, member(s) of his or her family, and the student’s Crew leader. As every learner is an active participant in his or her own learning, each student will likewise assume an active role in reflecting on it. By referring to the pieces in their subject area and Crew portfolios, students will speak to their academic and character growth. Presentations will be formally, thoroughly, and thoughtfully prepared by the student and his or her Crew leader well in advance of the conference.

Portfolios
Students use portfolios to organize and collect their work with meaningful reflection on their personal progress. Every student has a “Working Folder” in each class that will store his or her cumulative work for a trimester. Each trimester and in every class, including in Crew, students will, with teacher guidance, collect the pieces from their Working Folders that best demonstrate their growth in that discipline and their progress in meeting specific Learning Targets. This work is compiled into a “Trimester Portfolio,” which traces each student’s progress in a particular discipline for the school year. At the conclusion of each trimester, students will use their Portfolios to inform their formal and comprehensive reflections in Student Led Conferences.
