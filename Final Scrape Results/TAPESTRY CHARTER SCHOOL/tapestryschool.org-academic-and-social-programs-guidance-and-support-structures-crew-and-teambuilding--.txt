Crew & Team Building
Crew is a daily class dedicated to the academic and character growth of each student in becoming a positive community member. Crews meet for at least thirty-minute daily. Each “crew” is comprised of one adult employee and approximately eight to twelve students. In crew, the adult serves as an academic advisor to students and immediate contact for parents when their child is struggling in any one of his or her classes.
Crew time is spent in a variety of ways: Crew leaders support students’ daily academic work, by supplementing their expeditionary work, and by assisting students in organizing their portfolios and preparing for 
Student Led Conferences
. In addition, Crew time is devoted to service projects and teambuilding exercises, as well as to physical and personal wellness. Through processes of instruction, discussion, and reflection, Crew offers the support students not only need to be better students at Tapestry, but to be principled, compassionate, and responsible members of their community.
‘Crew’ is fully implemented in grades 5-12. Students in grades K-4 are introduced to the ‘crew’ structure via daily ‘class meetings’. Class meetings are led by the classroom teacher and are designed to promote team-building.
