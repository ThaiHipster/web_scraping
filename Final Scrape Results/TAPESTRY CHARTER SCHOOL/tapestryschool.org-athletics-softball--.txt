Varsity Softball Coach: Kelly Kilonsky
Softball Calander and Schedule
Kelly's coaching experience is through Hertel North Park Youth Baseball and Softball League.  For a number of years, she has coached several teams at varying age levels for the league's travel and house program.  She began as an assistant and over the past several years has taken on a head coaching position. 
Kelly has a passion for softball and a commitment to coaching.  She utilizes trainings she has learned through the years to try and improve each athlete's play.  She strongly believes that a key to coaching is that each player be allowed to voice her opinion.  Listening to a player's input and feedback is vital to the team's success and has made Kelly become a stronger coach.  
Kelly also has 4 daughters who attend Tapestry, two of which are on the softball team.
