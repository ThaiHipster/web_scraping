Our School Model
“A shared vision is not an idea...it is rather, a force in people's hearts...at its simplest level, a shared vision is the answer to the question 'What do we want to create?’” - Peter Senge, Director of the Center for Organizational Learning
It is often said that ‘a whole is greater than the sum of its parts’. Tapestry Charter School proves this adage to be true. Tapestry Charter School is a unique combination of successful ‘parts’:
NYS Charter School
Expeditionary Learning National Mentor School
Arts-Integrated School
Professional Development School
In whole, Tapestry Charter School is, above all else, a vibrant community of learners and leaders. Learners and leaders – students, parents, teachers and administrators alike – share a commitment to excellence.
