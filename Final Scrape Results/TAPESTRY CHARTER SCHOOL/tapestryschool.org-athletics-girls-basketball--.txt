Coaching Bio: Douglas Hearon
     I have been involved in Girls Basketball for over 10 years. Coaching, Training, Developing, on many different levels and platforms. I ran my own AAU Organization named the Lady Lions Basketball Club for 7 years. Within that time I trained, developed, and coached girls that didn’t know how to play basketball to developing them into College Scholarship kids. I have had over 15 kids in my program go on to play College Basketball. From D1, D2, D3, to JUCO. My program played on a National Level throughout the country, playing at the most prestigious high level AAU events on the AAU Circuit. Establishing great relationships with College Coaches and Programs that I still have today. I have also coached and ran the middle school basketball program at Tapestry High School for 3 years. Our middle school program has won one league championship, and played in the championship game every year I coached. I was also an assistant coach for Tapestry High School for two seasons. My first season we won the Class C Championship.
            I played Basketball my whole life as well. I played high school basketball for some great coaches that are known as legends in WNY. I played College Basketball in Junior College (Hudson Valley CC) and D2 Naia (University of Pittsburgh at Bradford). My athletic career and background has formed and shaped my philosophies of coaching and teaching. Sports is a great teacher of life and can develop great values and work ethic. The High School Girls Basketball Program that I want to help build at Tapestry is one that I want based on great work ethic, discipline, and structure. With the support of the Tapestry Athletic Department and Staff we can build Tapestry girls Basketball into a household name in girls’ basketball throughout WNY.
