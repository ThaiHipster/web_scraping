Intensives
The purpose of intensives is to provide opportunities to study and teach topics in-depth; to provide non- traditional learning experiences that engage students in new ways; to allow teachers to develop specialized courses based on their passions and expertise; to connect students with their local community through fieldwork, adventure, and internships; and to build character through teamwork, fieldwork, and adventure experiences.
All students participate in an enrichment experience during a two-day school wide intensive “break,” which is held mid-year. Intensives are held once a year and allow for multiple grade levels to learn together. Students choose from a wide variety of choices for their experience. Habits Of Work grades from 1st Trimester Report Cards and 2nd Trimester Progress Reports are considered for eligibility of participation/enrollment.
For two days, Tapestry Charter High School students and staff explored various topics that can be read about in our 2017
