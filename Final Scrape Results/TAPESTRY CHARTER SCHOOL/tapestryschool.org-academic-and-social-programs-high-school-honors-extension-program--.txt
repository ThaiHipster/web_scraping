Honors Extension Program
From its beginning, Tapestry Charter School made a commitment to provide a rigorous college preparatory program that encourages students to demonstrate intellectual and character growth, and that gives all students the widest range of options for their futures. For all students, the Tapestry values real world experiences that expose young people to the excitement and complexity of the community beyond school walls.
A high value is placed upon appreciation of social justice issues as all members of the Tapestry community work together to create a safe, healthy, and respectful learning community. In fact, the true diversity of an urban school population presents an authentic test of our values and requires creative problem solving. How does a small school community promote social justice, equity, and high academic standards, while serving the individual academic needs of students from all parts of our highly segregated city?
The Honors Extension Program is an essential component of our response to this challenge. In order to recognize and encourage achievement of students who distinguish themselves beyond the standard level, the Honors Extension Program is offered. Students must apply for acceptance and then participate in the various components of the program, including research papers, an honors seminar, and community activities.
Official transcripts for students who successfully complete the Tapestry Charter High School Honors Extension Program include a statement confirming program participation. Each student is also granted a personalized Honors Diploma at graduation.
