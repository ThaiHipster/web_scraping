Message from the Principal - 11/27/17
Dear Tapestry 6-12 Families,
I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving and were able to take time to reconnect with friends and family. I would like to thank all the students and families who participated in SLC’s.  If you were unable to attend your child’s SLC, please expect a follow-up phone call from your student’s crew leader. SLC’s are required for all students and are an essential component of what makes Tapestry such a special learning community. 
With this being High School Spirit Week, we ask that our students continue to show our compass traits especially perseverance and respect. The intent of Spirit Week is to strengthen our school community, tighten our relationships, and make lasting memories. During this time we must still behave appropriately and maintain a safe school environment where students can learn at their highest potential.
On Friday, Mrs. Gordon, 9th grade literacy teacher, announced that she will no longer be teaching at Tapestry for she has accepted another teaching position. During this time during transition we are actively seeking qualified, certificated candidates to fill her position. The 9th grade students who had Mrs. Gordon as a crew teacher, will now have Mrs. Wutz.  
I would like to acknowledge the 101 high school and 96 middle school students who achieved either honor or high honor roll for the first quarter. This equates to 30% of our high school and almost 50% of our middle school. I am very proud of our scholars and the academic gains we are making as a school!
