High School Program
Freshman & Sophomore Years
Though many of the structures of an EL school are different from those of traditional high schools, the course credits earned are equivalent. Through active pedagogy embedded in a school culture of collegiality, safety, and academic seriousness, THS students will be expected to meet the NYS diploma standards for learning in all areas as indicated in the tables below. There is some flexibility in the timing of requirements for math and language other than English. Depending upon prior experience, students may accelerate or take additional time in those areas. In the last trimester of 10th grade, each student will be expected to satisfactorily present his or her Passage Portfolio to a panel of faculty and student representatives and community experts in order to earn promotion to 11th grade.
Junior & Senior Years
Students in junior and senior years at THS will be taking the additional required courses toward graduation with a Regents’ or Advanced Regents’ Diploma. Depending upon their choice of concentration, elective courses of study will vary from student to student. During junior and senior years, all students will be thoroughly guided through the necessary steps of preparation for the college application process.
A junior at THS will have participated in many Learning Expeditions during his or her first two years of high school. By the junior year, every student will understand the components of a high quality investigation and will be ready, with support from teachers, to craft an investigation based on his or her own interests. This investigation may include an internship. After the internship, teachers help students organize their documentation into a section of their graduation portfolios that they will present to a graduation before graduation.
By their senior year, students use their experiences to work with teachers to craft individual senior Learning Expeditions. During the third trimester of the senior year, students organize their documentation and reflections into a section of their Graduation Portfolios. This portfolio must be successfully presented to the Graduation Panel in order to be granted a THS diploma.
