“I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library.” - Jorge Luis Borges
At Tapestry, learners and leaders find themselves ‘at home’ at the library. The library (virtual or on-site!) is where ideas are inspired and learning begins. Please be sure to visit our school library regularly (check with your friendly librarian for hours and availability!) and access our online resources here:
