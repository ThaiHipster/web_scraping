5/6 Expedition, Fall 2013
5/6 Expedition, Fall 2013
This trimester, Fifth and Sixth grade students engaged in a study of the roles and relationships of organisms in natural systems by comparing organisms found in Delaware Park to the story of The Lorax.
Students examined the origin of Earth’s energy source (solar radiation); how energy is transformed by producers through the process of photosynthesis; how it flows through the system by consumers; and is finally cycled back into the system by the decomposers.  Students were then asked to predict and make inferences about how populations and species would be affected by disease, competition, loss of habitat, etc.   
Students especially focused on the role of plants as producers.   In the classroom, they conducted investigations and experiments on plant tropisms, color change, and photosynthesis.  In Delaware Park, they investigated tree diversity and the effects of disease by identifying tree species and locating signs of disease.  Student’s scientific processing skills were also sharpened by creating a leaf collection based on a dichotomous key.   
Through research and experts, students learned about the efforts of the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy and the City of Buffalo to reforest our city parks and save the trees from the devastating effects of the Emerald Ash Borer.
