Principal’s Advisory Group
The Principal’s Advisory Group (PAG) serves as a consultative body to assist the principal and administration in making decisions that reflect the interests of parents, faculty, and students. Community voice is encouraged in such areas as the setting and maintaining of school policies, the hiring of staff, the raising of funds, and the setting of priorities for use of funds.
The K-8 PAG was formed in 2010, using the fully-functional 9-12 PAG structure as a model. The group’s form and function is expected to continue to evolve.
Subcommittees of the PAG have been established to address topics that are considered important by Tapestry families. The PAG includes representatives from each of the following groups: Parents, Students, and Faculty, along with a seat for the Expeditionary Learning organization.
Any parent or faculty member may submit a proposal or a topic for clarification or action by the PAG. Any student can submit a proposal that will go through his/her crew. The crew will provide feedback and guidance to the student about the feasibility of the proposal, but will pass along the proposal for the PAG to consider. The PAG will prioritize proposals and seek feedback from the school community in making decisions.
The Principal’s Advisory Group (PAG) and Tapestry Community Association (TCA) combine their meetings monthly on Mondays at 6:30 pm in the K-8 cafeteria.
