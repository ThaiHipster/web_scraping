Our Code of Character
The Tapestry Charter School community is committed to intentionally designing, participating in and upholding our school-wide norms and our values – Visions, Passion, Wonder and Voice. Put simply, our school culture is intentionally shaped by our shared values.
Every school has a culture and accepted norms for behaviors. Usually these school cultures and norms evolve unintentionally out of the dynamics and interchange of personalities and events within the school community. But school culture can be created intentionally. When all essential partners consistently choose to behave in a manner that upholds its desired culture and norms, its staff members can intentionally and systemically improve the culture in their school. This leads to a rise in student achievement and a more productive and enjoyable learning environment for all.
Consistency, relational trust and accountability are proven to be essential in shaping intentional shifts in school culture. Families who are interested in learning more about this research are encouraged to request a copy of our school’s Code of Character handbook.
