K-5 Elementary Program
The academic program at Tapestry Charter School is based on the Expeditionary Learning model. Themes, concepts, and ideas introduced in the classroom are purposefully intergrated into arts instruction. Each classroom has a teacher and teaching assistant (second certified teacher). There are teachers in the following super subjects: art, music, dance, physical education, library science and Spanish. A school psychologist and a school nurse are also on staff. All classrooms are equipped with mini-libraries in addition to the full-service library located in the heart of the school.
We promote a school model that:
maximizes a safe and nurturing environment, promoting the physical, social, emotional, and cognitive development of children
helps students take responsibility for their behavior and learning
helps build self-confidence
fosters positive peer relationships
de-emphasizes age differences and competitiveness
encourages student leadership
is built on continuous student progress
involves an integrated curricular approach to instruction
is child centered – unlocks graded curriculum boundaries and enhances opportunities for acceleration
provides peer tutoring opportunities, expanding the learning experience for all
provides opportunity for children to challenge themselves and others to higher level skills
expands teacher contact time with individual students
enables children to work at a variety of developmental levels without remediation
provides the basic needs of gifted and talented children
