Guidance & Support Structures
The overall goal of Tapestry Charter School is to support a high level of student learning and personal growth. In service of that goal, many support structures are provided for students. These structures support both low and high achievers, and they are put into place before the school year begins (e.g., summer leadership camp), during the trimesters (e.g., After School Study Center, Honors Extension Program), between trimesters (e.g., Academic and Enrichment Intensives), and at the end of the school year (e.g., Summer School Program).
Support structures are available through classroom teachers, support staff, administrators, and community resources. They include, but are not limited to:
Academic Support periods during the school day
After School Study Center
Book Clubs
College Preparation
Community Partnerships (e.g., Talent Search at Canisius College, Liberty Partnership with Buffalo State College)
Community tutors at neighborhood centers in Buffalo
Guidance Office
Honors Extension Program
Intensives - Academic and Enrichment
Literacy Workshop
One-on-one and small-group teacher support after school
Student Led Conferences & Passage Portfolio Presentations
