College Credit Plus
Now Earn College and High School Credit at the Same Time!
Why wait for your future?
With College Credit Plus, you can earn college and high school credits at the same time...
And if you take courses from a public college, it’s free!
College Credit PLUS
Ohio’s new College Credit Plus can help you earn college and high school credits at the same time by taking college courses from colleges and/or universities. The purpose of this program is to promote rigorous academic pursuits and to provide a wide variety of options to college-ready students. Taking a College Credit Plus course from a public college or university is free, which means no cost for tuition, books, or fees. If you choose to attend a private college or university, you may have limited costs.
Your high school may have an agreement with a local college for specific courses; however, you can choose to take College Credit Plus courses that would benefit your future from any college. This includes online courses. Download the complete brochure
