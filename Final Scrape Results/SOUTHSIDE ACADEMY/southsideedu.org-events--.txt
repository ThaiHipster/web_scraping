South Side Academy’s Book Swap            
South Side Academy is hosting its first annual book swap in the main hallway of South Side Academy located on Youngstown’s south side at 1400 Oak Hill Avenue on November 16, 2017 from 8:00 am to 2:00 pm. 
South Side Academy would like to save families money and promote the importance of reading by allowing a place to swap out their favorite books with something new to read. Community members can bring in any gently used book that they would like to share with others and trade it for a “new to you” book.  Enjoy refreshments and take a tour of the school.

Come in for a tour of our building or give us a call at 330-774-5562, weekdays between 7:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. We cannot wait to see you!
