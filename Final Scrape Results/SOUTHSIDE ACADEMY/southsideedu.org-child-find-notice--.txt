Child Find Notice
South Side Academy, an Ohio Community School, sponsored by Ohio Council of Community Schools is participating in the effort to identify, locate, and evaluate all children from birth through 21 year of age who may have disabilities. If you have or know a child who may have a disability, contact the school for more information and help. Ohio Administrative Code 3301-51 (B)(10) defines “Child with a disability” as a child evaluated in accordance with Rule 3301-51-006 of the Administrative Code as having a cognitive disability (mental retardation), a hearing impairment (including deafness), a speech or language impairment, a visual impairment (including blindness), a serious emotional disturbance, an orthopedic impairment, autism, traumatic brain injury, or other impairment, a specific learning disability, deaf-blindness, or multiple disabilities, and who, by reason thereof, needs special education and related services.
The school will ask for information specifically about the nature of the child’s disability, specific steps taken to address the disability, and what background or testing information is available regarding the child’s disability. The answers to these questions along with additional information gathered by the community school will be used to determine if the school’s suspects a disability.
If the community school suspects a disability, the school will conduct an evaluation, which may consist of interviews, observations, screenings, and testing. This information may be obtained from parents and the student, or from other agencies that have information about the student. This information will be used to decide whether the child has disability and what special services the child may need. All information collected will be held in strict confidences and released to others only with parent/guardian permissions or as allowed by law. Parents have the right to: review their child’s records; refuse permission to release information (except as required by or permitted by law to be released); and request that information they believe to be inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of their child’s privacy or other right, be changed.
The school has a process to resolve disagreements about information collected. If you or someone you know has a child who needs assistance, specifically related to a disability, you may contact the school’s principal.
