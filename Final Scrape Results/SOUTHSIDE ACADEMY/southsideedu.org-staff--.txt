Stephanie Groscost, Principal, South Side Academy
SGroscost@southsideedu.org
I have spent the majority of my educational career with the same students and families of South Side Academy. I have been at the school for nearly nineteen years, in various capacities. Although South Side Academy has changed management companies and recently moved to a different building, many of the same families have been here all along. I have taught second, fifth, and sixth grades. I have been the Curriculum Director, Dean of Students, Assistant Principal, and I am now the Principal of some children whose parents sat in my classroom. I am the proud mother of two wonderful daughters, 19 and 16, and have a wonderful husband. I enjoy reading, bike riding, crafts, being a “dance mom,” and learning new concepts to enhance the achievement of my students.

My name is Elaina J. Pierce I’m an Instructional Assistant and have been for almost 20 years. I grew up in a family of educators which is why  helping children is natural to me. My passion to help children become successful and know that they do not have to be a product of their environment. I want to be a positive person that they can look up to and a person of understanding. In some cases school is a child’s place of peace and I want to be the one to help educate and give them the peace, confidence, and state of reasoning that they need. I love the job I do.

My name is Allyson Wigington and I am excited to spend my first year teaching here at South Side Academy!  I recently graduated from Ohio University with my Bachelors in Middle Childhood Education with certification in Mathematics and Science.

I was born & raised in St. Croix, USVI which is a United States territory in the Caribbean.  I attended college right after high school at age 17.  I’ve been married for 16 years with three kids. I live and work in the Youngstown area.  After graduating with my B.S in Education and a minor in science, I taught 8th grade Science in Cleveland and Special needs preschool in Youngstown.  While those degrees were rewarding, I felt I had more knowledge to gain and offer to my students.  I returned to school and graduated with a Master of Education degree in Curriculum & Instruction.  I am a life-long learner who attains knowledge to share with others.  In 2014 I returned to YSU to gain my Integrated Science Licensure K-12 with one more class left to complete.  Learning I believe should be hands-on, creative, meaningful and fun.  I know the reward will be fulfilling and the knowledge I gain, I can share with my students: “ Learning & knowledge is rewarding; it is another goal completed once you stay focused on your task.  Learning does not stop at a certain age; it is a life-long process that continues to grow and expand your mind, thinking, cognitive development, and job qualification/skill.

This is my first year at South Side Academy.  I grew up in Euclid, a suburb east of Cleveland, and now I live in Ashtabula County.  I am married to a 4th grade teacher for the Geneva Area City Schools.  We have three daughters – Julia (10), Jenna (7), and Joanna (4).  I have a Masters’ Degree in Special Education and hold a Mild-Moderate Disabilities Licensure for Kindergarten through 12th grade.  I have been a teacher, a tutor, an aide, and a substitute in several different situations.  I also currently work for an in-home provider who provides assistance for adults with disabilities.  I enjoy the outdoors (especially camping), spending time with my family, sports card collecting, and writing inspirational quotes.  I believe that all children are able to learn.  I am not a quitter and I will try and do anything possible to make your son or daughter successful this year.  My belief of success is that “Progress is one small step in the right direction.”
