Shelter and Resources for Homeless Young Adults 18-24
Lighthouse provides services aimed at helping young adults create a plan for self-sufficiency, safety and success.
Lighthouse meets the needs of homeless young adults; including emergency shelter, street outreach and a safe place to come off the streets and get basic need items. At Lighthouse, we work with young people as soon as they arrive at our door, regardless of the reasons that brought them to us.
