Dropout Prevention and Recovery
The staff at Lighthouse Community School helps students who have either dropped out of high school or are significantly off track toward degree completion.
Qualifications for the Dropout Recovery program include:
The student must not be younger than 16 or older than 21 at the time of  initial enrollment, and
The student must be at least one grade level behind their cohort age groups OR experience crises that significantly interfere with their academic progress in a traditional setting.
High School Credits: Students who successfully demonstrate achievement of the high school goals and objectives will earn one unit of credit per year in each subject area. These units of credit are transferable to any Ohio school and are equivalent to a Carnegie unit. Partial credits may be awarded on a prorated basis.
