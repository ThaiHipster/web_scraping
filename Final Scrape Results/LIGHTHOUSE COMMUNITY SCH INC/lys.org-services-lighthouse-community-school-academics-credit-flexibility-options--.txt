Class Credit Options
Credit flexibility is one way to increase a student’s interest in school and motivation to learn..
The key to this option is that the student drives the request to learn differently as well as the plan to earn the credit
Students can earn credits through:
the completion of courses
testing out or otherwise demonstrating mastery of the course content
pursuit of one or more educational options (e.g., distance learning, educational travel, independent study, an internship, after school/ tutorial program, community service or engagement project, or extracurricular activities). 
A student requests (written or verbal) to take a course and/or earn a credit via the credit flexibility option. The school counselor and/or a teacher and the student then develop a credit flexibility plan. 
The teacher and/or counselor assigned the plan oversees that the student is doing the work, meeting the goals and making progress in learning.  If the student does not complete all elements in the plan or is not successful in demonstrating the knowledge and skills needed, then the student will not earn the credit. It is the responsibility of the student to do the work to succeed in the plan. The teacher and/or counselor guides the student with feedback.
 The student, school officials and the student’s parents sign the agreement.
Agreement must be reached on several points:
The course content and academic credit to be included in the plan
How the student will demonstrate proficiency
The (assessment) instruments or (educational) programs to be used to demonstrate proficiency
The minimum threshold needed to award credit (percentage of passing rate on tests, performances, demonstration of competency, etc.)
How a grade level will be determined
The consequences of not completing the plan or doing failing work
When the credit proficiency evidence will be due
How and when progress toward success can be demonstrated
What measures are to be used to verify completion of the credit flexibility
What costs, if any, must be assumed by the student
How does the credit flexibility appeals process work
Students may demonstrate mastery by completing a comprehensive exam which includes the essential knowledge and skills addressed in the traditional course. Tests used for this purpose shall be either comprehensive exams created for the course (final course exam); state-approved assessments (end-of-course exams); or commercially published assessments covering relevant content approved by the Superintendent(or designee) and may include a performance assessment component. After tests are scored, the student shall be notified of the grade for which he or she would be eligible. The student will be given the choice of accepting the credit and grade earned based on the assessment or completing a traditional course or other option approved by the superintendent(or designee).
