Life Skills & Housing Options for Young Adults 17-24
Guiding young adults to self-sufficiency while living independently.
Through Lighthouse Youth Housing Opportunities, young adults master essential life skills while living in safe, furnished apartments.
This service is only available to:
Young adults 17-24 years old who are in custody of the child welfare system/aging out of the child welfare system
Young adults 18-24 years old who are homeless*
Lighthouse provides each young adult with a furnished apartment and basic household supplies. There is a range of housing options, including supervised living in agency owned buildings and scattered site apartments.
Lighthouse staff provides life skill training which encompasses managing money, job and educational assistance, handling transportation, caring for personal health, housework, shopping and preparing food. Case management is provided to link clients to community resources, support achievement of individual goals and movement toward self-sufficiency. Mental health counseling is available as needed.
*A study funded by the federal government is being done to determine how Lighthouse Youth Services helps youth attain housing, education, and employment, and live independently. There will be more applicants than spaces available in this program. Youth who are eligible for the program and agree to participate in the study will be selected into the program based on a lottery, so some youth will get into the program and some will not.
