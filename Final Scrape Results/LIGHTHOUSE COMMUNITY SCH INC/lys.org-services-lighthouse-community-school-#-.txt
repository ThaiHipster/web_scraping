Lighthouse Community School
A community charter school specializing in individualized, flexible and intensive strategies to meet the educational needs of youth in the child welfare system.
Lighthouse Community School offers accredited, academic services for students in grades 6th – 12th, ages 13 – 21. Drop out recovery services are available for students ages 6 – 21 who are at least one grade level behind.
We take pride in employing unconditional positive approaches to foster a safe, stable community that develops effective social skills and enhances academic progress for students whose current or ongoing needs are best met in our small school.
Lighthouse Community School’s educational philosophy:
Students learn best when using academic concepts and skills and writing collaboratively to solve real-world problems in a caring, structured environment.
All students need challenging work to facilitate interest and learning.
Education is a major factor in fostering civility, good citizenship, responsible behavior and self-reliance.
