Special Education
Do you suspect your child may have an emotional, mental, or physical disability? Does your child have frequent disciplinary problems? The staff at Lighthouse Community School can provide help.
Lighthouse Community School provides special education testing services at no cost. Each child will receive an Evaluation Team Report, which determines whether or not a child qualifies for special education services.
If a child qualifies for special education services they will be given an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) and/or 504 plan. Individualized Education Plans provide students with academic and/or behavioral goals to help teachers better accommodate your child’s needs. An IEP ensures each child’s educational experience is academically, emotionally, and socially rewarding.
All procedures performed at Lighthouse Community School are in accordance with IDEA and Operating Standards for Ohio Educational Agencies Serving Children with Disabilities Procedural Safeguards.
