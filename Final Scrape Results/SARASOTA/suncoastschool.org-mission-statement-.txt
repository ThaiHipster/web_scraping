Mission Statement
The Mission of SSIS is to celebrate and recognize each individual child so that all students will achieve their full intellectual and social potential. Family commitment to the learning process, as well as, the use of multi-age groupings and multi-modality teaching, will help develop in each child a love of learning, the ability to engage in critical thinking, and mastery of comprehensive academics. Families and the larger community will be partners in the achievement of the student.
