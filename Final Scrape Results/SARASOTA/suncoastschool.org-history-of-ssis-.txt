History of SSIS
﻿Suncoast School for Innovative Studies date of Incorporation was August 3, 1998. The school was opened August 1999 as one of the 3 original Charter Schools in Sarasota County.The original Charter called for an enrollment of approximately 100 students, grades K-8, broken down Grades K-2: 20 students, Grades 3-5: 30 students, Grades 6-8: 50 students. This enrollment configuration allowed for a unique peer mentoring program that paired every middle school student with an elementary student. The mentoring program was one of the key innovations of the school model. The educational program of Suncoast School for Innovative Studies was designed to utilize methods incorporating multiple intelligences, learning styles, authentic assessment, multidisciplinary learning units, and opportunities for self-growth and self-expression. Technology in 1999, as designed in the original Charter, would be used in a variety of ways to teach Internet navigation, word processing, business writing, presentation skills, spread sheet and database applications. The goal of the school would be to increase productivity through a low ratio of students-to-work stations.
That goal is still the goal of SSIS. As our mission states, we recognize and celebrate each individual child so that all students will achieve their full intellectual and social potential.
