Academic Eligibility
Academics are the first priority of all students at SSIS.If a student is behind or missing class work, they will be held out of practice until all work has been completed.  Students will always be excused from practices in order to receive extra help from their teachers. Never hesitate to ask questions in fear of missing a practice session.
Academics are #1
Participation in interscholastic sports is a privilege.  Students wishing to participate must be held to a higher set of rules. Higher academic standards are just one of the rules that student-athletes must comply with in order to eligible to participate.
