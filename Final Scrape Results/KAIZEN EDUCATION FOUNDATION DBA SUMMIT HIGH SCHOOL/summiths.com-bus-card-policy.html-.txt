Bus Card Policy
Summit High School assists students with transportation by providing bus cards at a discounted rate. Summit purchases the bus cards from Valley Metro at full price and resells the cards to students at a discounted rate of $10 for a 31-day pass or $5 for a 15-day pass. The card is only sold to students for the purpose of getting them to and from school. Any student, who drives or is driven to and from school, will not be allowed to purchase a bus card at a reduced rate. Any student who is caught misusing their bus card will have their bus card privileges revoked. Any student who has excessive absences within a month will be asked to pay full price for their bus card, $32.50 for the 31-day pass or $16.50 for the 15-day pass. 
Any student who qualifies for a bus card and has perfect attendance within the month will earn a free 31-day bus card for the upcoming month
. Perfect attendance is defined as a student who has attended school every day since their last bus pass was issued  and has not missed any of his/her classes or has flexed all absences. 
If a student’s bus card is lost or stolen, Summit is not responsible for replacing the card. The student may purchase a replacement card at full price.
