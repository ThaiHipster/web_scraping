Policies
Respect and mature conduct in the school is of primary importance to staff members, parents/guardians, and other students. The maintenance of orderly conduct of students is necessary in every school situation to ensure the health and safety of all and to maximize learning. Effective discipline is a necessity for quality education.
Summit High School's fundamental philosophical basis of effective discipline is that students are responsible for their own actions and are expected to show respect and consideration for the right of others.
In addition to appropriate behavior at school, students are expected to exhibit proper behavior on their way to school, on their way home, and when participating in school activities.
