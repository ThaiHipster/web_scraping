School Performance
Summit High School  met the AIMS testing levels required for Adequate Yearly Progress. The  school also is listed as a Performing school by the Arizona Department  of Education.
 Performing status  is determined by standards set by the state of Arizona. A high school's  status is determined by the performances of its students on the reading,  mathematics and writing portions of the AIMS test and by the school's  drop-out rate, graduation rate and Adequate Yearly Progress status.  Again, Summit High School met these requirements.
Summit High School  is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools,  an independent organization that reviews public schools and colleges.  The accreditation process consists of a thorough review, evaluation and  graded report of the school's mission, performance goals, courses,  teacher instruction, administrative procedures and achievement data, to  name a few areas, by a North Central Association team.
 To students and  parents, accreditation means that student transcripts and grades are  accepted by colleges throughout the country.
