National School Lunch Program (NSLP)
Welcome to the Summit High School National School Lunch Program.
We are pleased to inform you that all children attending Summit High School will receive breakfast and lunch at no charge during school year 2016-2017 unless otherwise notified. Summit High School will be participating in a special provision offered by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) that affects the traditional operating procedures of the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). Under this provision, it is not necessary to distribute household applications among families with children in attendance. We appreciate your cooperation in previous years and will notify you of any changes to the program in future years.
