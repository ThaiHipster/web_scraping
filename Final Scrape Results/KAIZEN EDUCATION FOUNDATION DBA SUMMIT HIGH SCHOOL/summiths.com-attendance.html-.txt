Attendance Policy
Summit High School operates on a Block Schedule. Each Block consists of 36 days. Arizona law requires that a student attend a set amount of time to receive credit. Therefore, if a student accumulates more than four un-flexed absences during the block, the student may receive a letter grade of an “F” for that class. Any absences accumulated during the week must be flexed by day’s end Friday of the same week the absence occurred.  All absences are encouraged to be phoned into the office on the day of the absence. At the end of the block, the earned credit is then applied to the transcript. This system offers the student the motivational advantage of being able to earn a positive reward in a shorter amount of time. It also allows the student who has fallen behind to catch up and graduate before the end of the school year. 
  In order to receive credit for a class, the student must attend class and complete all work required at a level that is acceptable by the teacher. Attendance is mandatory. If a student misses more than ten consecutive days of classes, then he/she is dropped from school and must re-enroll at Summit High School.  Students in this situation may be placed in an alternative credit recovery program when they re-enroll.
  If an illness or emergency occurs that keeps the student from attending school, the parent or guardian must contact the school and explain the reason for missing classes. When the student returns, she/he is responsible for completing all work missed. In the event of a hospitalization or doctor's appointment, Summit High School requires an original signed note from a health-care provider.
