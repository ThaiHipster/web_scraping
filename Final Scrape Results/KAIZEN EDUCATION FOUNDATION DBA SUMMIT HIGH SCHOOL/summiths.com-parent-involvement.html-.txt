Parent Involvement
Title I Policy
As presented - September 7th, 2017 @ 5:00 pm
Title I Parent Involvement Policy
A strong partnership between the school and home is essential if a quality education program is to be provided to all students.  Summit High School is dedicated to the philosophy that parent involvement is integral to the success of each student.  For this reason, parents are actively recruited as our partners for success.  The parent involvement policy is reviewed by all stakeholders during our Title I advisory meeting, with parents, for the year.  The policy will be given to parents during spring report card time and it will be published to the school website.  In order for parents to understand the policy, this document is written as clearly as possible.
In the fall, an Open House is held to introduce parents to Summit and its school wide program.  Parents are informed of the many opportunities for involvement, such as daily teacher communication via phone or email, Open House conferences, and AdvancEd focus groups and committees, and community activities/events sponsored by Summit High School.  Parents meet the principal and leadership teams in an effort to ease the transition into and through high school.
In meetings, parents learn about the nature of the annual meetings that inform parents of the school’s participation in the Title I program.  Parents are also provided with explanations of the requirements of the program and the parents’ rights.  They learn that:
Parent meetings and conferences can be held on campus before class, after class, and anytime on Fridays.  Parents are also encouraged to teleconference with their students’ teachers and leadership when transportation or work obligations prevent their commute to the campus
Title I funds may be used to pay reasonable and necessary expenses associated with parent involvement activities that may include: transportation, child care costs, or home visit expenses that can enable parents to participate in school-related meetings and trainings
Parents will be involved in the planning, review, and improvement of Summit High School’s Title I program and Title I policy and Parent Involvement Policy.  Parents will have the opportunity to be a part of the advisory meetings.  Also, parents are always invited to the NCLB meetings and school-community events as advertised on the website
Summit will provide parents with timely information about the Title I program. Our website, notes on report cards, calendars, and minutes from the site based meetings will give current information.
Summit will provide parents with a description and explanation of the curriculum used, the forms of academic assessments used to measure student progress and proficiency levels, and levels students are expected to meet in the form of the Stanford 10, AIMS, and AZELLA scores.  These can be explained by teachers in a conference or by the administration.
If requested by parents, Summit will provide appropriate parent participation opportunities for regular meetings to formulate suggestions in decisions relating to a student’s education.  These can be individual parent conferences or group meetings to discuss issues that pertain to students.
The Parent-School Compact, signed during the enrollment conference by students, parents, and principal, will outline how everyone will share in the responsibility for improved student achievement
If needed, Summit will provide assistance in understanding the state’s academic content standards, the state student achievement standards, and the local assessment through the use of teachers, academic advisors, technology, and training (as necessary).
Parents can monitor their child’s progress and improve their achievement by logging on to the PASS system and viewing their student’s grades and academic progress
Summit High School will ensure that information relating to school meetings, parent programs, and associated activities will be sent to participating children in a form and language that parents can understand.
Academic advisers, ELD teachers, school leaders, and special education teachers will be available where required.
