HAYS COUNTY CAMPUS
ABOUT Hays County Campus
Hays Campus is located inside of the Hays County Juvenile Center in San Marcos, Texas. Hays County operates the Hays Center, and the Texas Juvenile Probation Commission provides the license.
Hays is a 135-bed, locked-down, military style facility serving both pre- and post- adjudicated youth. The facility programs include treating drug and alcohol abuse and sexual offenders. County juvenile probation departments place youth in the facility.
Hays campus serves boys and girls ages 10 to 17. Our current enrollment is 110 students with about 20% receiving special education services.
Our school staff includes a principal, assistant principal, educational diagnostician, registrar, five core content teachers (math, science, social studies, and English), a P.E. teacher, a technology assistant, and seven instructional assistants.
The campus uses the C-Scope curriculum and students have access to a full range of computer-assisted instruction including A+ learning, Accelerated Math, and Study Island.
