AFTON OAKS CAMPUS
ABOUT Afton Oaks Campus
Afton Oaks Campus is located inside of the Hector Garza Residential Treatment Center in San Antonio, Texas.
Hector Garza is a 125-bed, staff-secure facility, privately operated by the Abraxas Youth and Family Services Program, a division of the Cornell Companies. Child Protective Services (CPS), the Texas Youth Commission, and county juvenile probation departments refer adolescents to the facility.
Our Afton campus serves students ages 10 to 17 who have severe behavior and emotional disorders. Current enrollment at the campus is 130 students with about 50% in special education.
Our school staff includes a principal, assistant principal, LSSP, educational diagnostician, registrar, core content teachers (English, math, science, and social studies), a P.E. teacher, a life college guide, and instructional assistants. Additionally, Afton has special education teachers that provide resource classes and tutoring.
The campus uses the C-Scope curriculum, and students have access to a full range of computer-assisted instruction including A+ learning, Accelerated Math, and Study Island.
