FROM THE PRINCIPAL'S DESK
At Williams House, we believe children should learn the academic and social skills to give them the traits necessary to increase the capacity for human greatness. While instilling the importance of trying to do your best we have created our school rules: be safe, belong, be great, and find joy. Assisting your student with understanding the importance of these rules and reinforcing their concepts assures that Williams House School is a safe, healthy, and positive environment for everyone. 
Teachers, facility staff, parents/guardians, and the community working hand-in-hand assure that we are helping our children learn the skills to become leaders for tomorrow. Because we understand that students learn in diverse ways we value a variety of learning styles and teaching styles. We use data to inform instruction, intervention, and enrichment. We understand education is the key to a successful life, and all of us are dedicated to providing the children of Williams House with a quality education in a safe environment. By focusing on learning we work together to create a life worth living. As a collaborative team, our staff devotes itself to helping every student achieve success. Remember, if you have any questions or concerns please contact us. This is going to be a great year!
Stephanie House, M.Ed.. (abd) Ed.D.
Principal
