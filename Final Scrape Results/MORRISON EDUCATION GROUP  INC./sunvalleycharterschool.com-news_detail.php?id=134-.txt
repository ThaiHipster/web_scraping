“Amazing school with amazing staff. I love how involved some of the teachers are with their students and above and beyond for the student's comfort so they can learn more. For example, Mrs. Yee is amazing in helping my daughter with not only her education but also and her self-worth and she does all that while enforcing strict rules and respect for others.”

The Bees are Buzzing and the SUN is Shining!!!
The Bees are Buzzing and the SUN is Shining!!! As many may have heard the state wide letter grade rankings were released yesterday to the public. We are proud to “Bee” a B ranked school Buzzing our way to an A!! This places Sun Valley among the highest performing schools in the Laveen/South Mountain area! We are so thankful for our amazing staff, our hard-working scholars, and our supportive families and community that has helped us reach this achievement. Thank you for your support and belief in our school’s mission...truly a team effort! Please know that we are not resting on a B ranking, but are working even harder this year! We have intensified our efforts through: A more rigorous and data driven instructional process Increased professional development and support for teachers and staff A refined academic intervention process when scholars need extra support Constant access for parents to see current grades through Schoolmaster Increased parent/school communication through school wide use of ClassDojo Becoming a fully endorsed Leader in Me school with year long training Whew that’s a lot of effort!! But our scholars are worth it!! And one last piece of “Buzz” worthy news...Sun Valley is now in a place where we can explore expansion opportunities so stay tuned!! The SUN is truly shining so let’s keep “Buzzing” our way to the top!!!
