At Zoë Learning Academy students are encouraged to make appropriate choices regarding their personal conduct. Following are the chief means by which faculty and staff will ensure order and support the development of good character at school. The educational motto for the 2016-2017 school years is "ZLA: Where every child is striving to be great." This year, ZLA is implementing the Find the Good in Everyone program. The program is designed to catch star performances for good grades, behavior, character, etc. The program promotes self-motivation and determination on behalf of all learners.
Zoë Learning Academy 
recognize that effective instruction requires an orderly environment focused on learning and that schools have an important role to play in supporting parents’ efforts to teach basic values to their children. The School's Code of Conduct clearly defines expectations for student conduct, focusing on ten character virtues: responsibility, perseverance, respect, kindness, truth, citizenship, courage, self-discipline, fairness, and true friendship. These "Keys for Success" are the cornerstone of School's character education curriculum, and students focus on each in turn throughout the school year. Students are encouraged to model the character virtues in their every action and thereby to develop the habits that characterize a civil society. Parents can help reinforces such lessons by talking about the virtues and encouraging students to model them at home.
A complete copy of the Student Code of Conduct is provided in this Handbook. Please read the Student Code of Conduct thoroughly, discuss it with your child, and sign the pledge at the end of the Handbook. The pledge is to be turned in to the office where it will be placed in the child’s permanent file. The pledge serves as a contract among students, parents, and School staff, involving parent’s at the most fundamental level in their children’s character development. The School Principal will make appointments to discuss the Student Code of Conduct with any parent who does not return signed copies of the form indicating their approval of the Student Code of Conduct.
In addition to the expectations described in the Student Code of Conduct, the following rules apply in every classroom at the elementary level:
  Follow directions the first time given
  Be in the learner position at appropriate times 
(seated with feet flat on the floor and hands folded on your desk)
  Keep hands, feet, and objects to yourself
  Get attention the right way
  Transition quickly and quietly
  Be prepared for each class
Helping your child meet these expectations will facilitate the creation 
of a safe and orderly learning environment.
