ENROLLMENT PROCESS
TWO DIMENSIONS PREPARATORY ACADEMY’S ENROLLMENT PROCESS
Step 1:  Complete Lottery Application
Lottery Applications become available March of every year.  The applications must be submitted by the end of the current school year in order to be considered for the upcoming school year.  The lottery applications are made available on our website. 
Step 2:  Lottery
A lottery for all of our campuses is conducted the end of June every year.  Once the lottery has been completed, selected parents of students are contacted via phone or e-mail with instructions for enrollment.
Step 3:  Enrollment
In order to complete enrollment, parents must visit the campus in person with all of the necessary documents on the scheduled date and time.  Parents selected in the initial lottery will have the information needed to complete the enrollment process at least one month in advance.  Parents that do not complete enrollment during the allotted time and have not expressed a desire to do so will forfeit the student’s acceptance so that another parent may have that opportunity to enroll.
Step 4: First Day of School
Finally, the enrollment process is not complete until the child is counted present on the first day of school.  Thus, it is imperative that parents ensure that their child arrives to school on time so that he/she can be situated during attendance.
