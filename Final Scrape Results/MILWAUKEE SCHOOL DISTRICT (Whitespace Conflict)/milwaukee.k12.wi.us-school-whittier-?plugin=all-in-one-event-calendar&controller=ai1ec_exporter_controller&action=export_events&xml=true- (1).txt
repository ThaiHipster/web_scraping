Families with special needs children will be the focus of MPS’ 15th annual Foro Latino event. More than 25 community agencies will be on hand to provide information and workshops. This resource fair improves access to support for children with special needs.
Foro Latino is set for Friday, November 10, 2017 from 4:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. at Milwaukee Public Schools South Division High School, 1515 W. Lapham Boulevard, Milwaukee, 53204.
Foro Latino will be presented in Spanish and interpreted in English. It is the only event of its kind in the state. Attendees will have access to a wide range of community resources, including flu shots, and will have opportunities to network with other families who have children with special needs.
Food and door prizes will be available along with activities for children. For more information or to register, call (414) 643-0022.
The event is a collaboration uniting MPS, Alianza Latino Aplicando Soluciones, the U.S. Department of Education, Milwaukee County, the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, Southeast Regional Center for Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs, and Disability Rights Wisconsin.
