IB MYP Language and Literature
MYP Language and Literature is academically rigorous, and equips students with linguistic, analytical and communicative skills that can also be used in an interdisciplinary manner across all other subject groups. There are six skill areas: listening, speaking, reading, writing, viewing and presenting, which develop as both independent and interdependent skills. The aims are to encourage and enable students to use lanaguage as a vehicle for thought, creativity, reflection, learning, self expression and social interaction.
