FAQ
 Many visitors to our website may have the same common questions. Hopefully this page will help answer those common questions so that you don't have to call or email to try to find simple answers!
What is meant by A and B days?    
In the upper school, students go to four periods per day. Having A and B days allows students to take eight subjects. A and B days alternate, so students only go to their scheduled classes on those days every other day.
Middle school students taking upper level electives are affected by the A/B schedule for electives only.

What is Homework Hall?    
Homework Hall is a program that was started a few years ago and met with good success. In order to help students not fall behind academically, it gives them an opportunity to complete work that they might not finish on time. It is held after school from 3:10 to 4:10.
If a student does not have their homework completed at the time teacher is asking for it, the student is assigned homework hall for THAT DAY. The office is notified, and the parents are automatically called to let them know that their child has homework hall after school that day.
Students assigned to homework hall can take the Late Bus home after school.
What is the Late Bus?    
The Late Bus is school bus transportation that leaves school at 4:15, so that students needing to stay after school for specific purpose can get a ride home.
Students who have detention, or homework hall, or an afterschool extra-curricular activity can get a late bus pass for that day in order to be able to ride the late bus.
You MUST have a pass to get on late bus. The faculty member in charge of activities will give passes out at the end of the activity before student is dismissed to go to late bus.
Where can I find information on school lunch or breakfast?    
Go to the district 
Child Nutrition Services webpage 
How can I get a copy of my child's transcript?     
Go see the registrar in the Admissions Office (across from the Upper School office)
