Finding Faculty Information
 How do I find my teachers? 
There are two primary ways to find teachers. 
If you are in grades 6-9, your core teachers can be found on the associated grade level pages. For your elective teachers, you will need to look on the appropriate department pages. For grades 10-12, there are not specified families or houses for your core classes, so you will need to look on the department pages for the teacher.These pages contain teacher names, email addresses, and where to look for the class content they host online. 
How do I find my teacher's online content? 
By checking the appropriate grade level or department page, you can find what Content Management System (CMS) your teachers primarily use. If the CMS for a teacher isn't listed, then they haven't reported that information to the teacher who helps maintain the website. Please ask them directly if they haven't informed you through their syllabus or opening day information. This is a very recent change this year- please be patient with us.
Over the past 5 years, our district has switched from primarily utilizing teacher webpages, to a Content Management System(CMS), changed the district CMS, changed expectations in what we house on our website, started providing Google Drive accounts, and we have acquired our own CMS related to our participation in the IB. Please be patient with any of your teachers who may still be working across multiple systems.
