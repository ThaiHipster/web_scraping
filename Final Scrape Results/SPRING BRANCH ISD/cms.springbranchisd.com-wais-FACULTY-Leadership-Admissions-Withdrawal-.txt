Withdrawals
Withdrawing from WAIS requires purposeful planning.
Westchester’s practice is to maintain a standard of excellence.  Student and parent feedback are necessary as we continue to monitor and adjust our practices. When a student and their parent are considering withdrawing from WAIS, the conversation begins with the student’s counselor or Assistant Director. If at that time the decision is made to move forward with the withdrawal, the parent and student make an appointment to meet with Pam Butler, Interm Director of WAIS.
After meeting with Dr. Butler and the decision to withdraw has been made final, please notify the Registrar’s Office.  A student’s records must be cleared before they may be sent to any other school.
The withdrawal process will take 24 hours.
