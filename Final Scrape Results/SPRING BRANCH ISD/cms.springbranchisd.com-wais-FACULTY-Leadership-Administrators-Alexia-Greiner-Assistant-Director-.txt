About Me
I grew up in Liverpool, New York, which is a suburb of Syracuse.  I have been in education in some capacity for 28 years. I graduated Cum Laude from the State University of New York College at Cortland with a Bachelor of Science in Education and a Minor in Music. I also received a Master of Science in Education with an emphasis on Curriculum and Instruction from that same college. 
	I began my teaching career at Bear Road Elementary in the North Syracuse Central School District happily teaching students first in 4th, then 2nd, and finally 5th grade. After many years in elementary school, I felt it was time for a new challenge, and transferred to Roxboro Road Middle School where I first taught Social Studies and Math to 5th graders, and then Language Arts and Math to 6th graders until my family moved to Houston.  
	In July of 2001 my husband and I moved to Houston, and began our new life in this wonderful city. My Spring Branch career began at Northbrook Middle School where I taught 6th grade Math.  Then I became the Math School Improvement Specialist at Pine Shadows Elementary. While working at PSE, I received my Principal’s Certificate from the University of St. Thomas in Educational Administration.  
	Before joining the Westchester Academy family in the fall of 2013, I was an Assistant Principal at Bunker Hill Elementary, a Principal at Pine Shadows Elementary, and a Data Specialist in the Accountability and Research Department, all in SBISD.    
	Personally, I have been married to my husband Michael for 24 years. We have two very spoiled cats who rule the roost,Scotty, and Felix.   In my free time I enjoy making jewelry, reading, knitting, hunting, and all types of crafts.  I am very fortunate to call Houston my home and work at Westchester Academy.
