Why Projects in MYP?
The inquiry process in MYP projects involves students in a wide range of activities to extend their knowledge and understanding and to develop their skills and attitudes. These student-planned learning activities include: 
·  
deciding what they want to learn about, identifying what they already know, and discovering what they will need to know to complete the project 
·  
creating proposals or criteria for their project, planning their time and materials, and recording developments of the project 
·  
making decisions, developing understandings and solving problems, communicating with their supervisor and others, and creating a product or developing an outcome 
·  
evaluating the product/outcome and reflecting on their project and their learning. 
As students become involved in the self-initiated and self-directed learning process, they will find it easier to construct in-depth knowledge on their topic as well as to develop an understanding of themselves as learners.2

MYP Personal Project
 Personal Project  
The personal project encourages students to practice and strengthen their approaches to learning (ATL) skills, to consolidate prior and subject-specific learning, and to develop an area of personal interest. The personal project provides an excellent opportunity for students to produce a truly personal and often creative product/outcome and to demonstrate a consolidation of their learning in the MYP. The project offers many opportunities for differentiation of learning and expression according to students’ individual needs. The personal nature of the project is important; the project should revolve around a challenge that motivates and interests the individual student. Each student develops a personal project independently. 
MYP projects are student-centered and age-appropriate, and they enable students to engage in practical explorations through a cycle of inquiry, action and reflection. MYP projects help students to develop the attributes of the IB learner profile; provide students with an essential opportunity to demonstrate ATL skills developed through the MYP; and foster the development of independent, lifelong learners.1

 to
 encourage
 and
 enable
 students

•             participate
 in
 a
 sustained,
 self-directed
inquiry
 within
 a
global
 context
•        
generate
creative
 new
 insights
 and
develop
 deeper
 understandings
through
 in-depth
investigation
•            
demonstrate
 the
 skills,
attitudes
 and
 knowledge
required
 to
 complete
 a
 project
over
 an
 extended
 period
 of
time
•             communicate

 of
 situations
•

•             appreciate
 the
 process

 their
 accomplishments.
Students
 spend
 25
hours
 on
 their
 personal
project. This includes the formal report which can be produced in a variety of formats. Personal Project is started during the last 6-9 weeks of ninth grade during their Digital Communications course. Each student uses a program called ManageBac to help organize, structure, and monitor their project. 
The project is designed so that the student advocates and negotiates the process as the primary initiator which is very important since the topic of study is self-selected.
Sophomore students have support for Personal Project through the library, advisory class, English II, an assigned supervisor, and work-sessions.
ManageBac is a system designed for IB students. Parents can also access ManageBac providing information about students' progress with the MYP (IB) standards. Just email cheryl.wegscheid@springbranchisd.com with your child's name and the email address you would like linked to ManageBac.
