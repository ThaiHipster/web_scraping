Language Acquisition
Language Acquisition
The role of language is valued as central to developing critical thinking, which is essential for the cultivation of intercultural awareness, international-mindedness and global citizenship. Language is integral to exploring and sustaining personal development and cultural identity, and provides an intellectual framework to support conceptual development. In MYP Language Acquisition, the purposes and targets for learning language are divided into three areas of communication: oral communication, visual communication, and written communication. The Language Acquisition objectives are designed to enable students to become multiliterate by developing all three areas.  
Students will move through a vertically aligned series of units at Westchester as they pursue understanding of this new language.
