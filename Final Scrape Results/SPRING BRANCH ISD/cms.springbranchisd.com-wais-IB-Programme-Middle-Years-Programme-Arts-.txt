IB MYP Arts
In MYP arts students have opportunities to function as artists, as well as learners of the arts. Artists have to be curious. By developing curiosity about themselves, others and the world, students become effective learners, inquirers and creative problem-solvers. Students develop through creating, performing and presenting arts in ways that engage and convey feelings, experiences and ideas. It is through this practice that students acquire new skills and master those skills developed in prior learning.
Development in the arts is a dynamic process, and not necessarily linear. The student moves freely through a creative process towards a deeper understanding of the arts. MYP arts values the process of creating artwork and the point of realization; the two elements combined tell us what students have experienced, learned and attempted to convey.
Thinking creatively fits naturally in MYP arts. As both an objective in the arts and an approaches to learning (ATL) skill across the programme, heightened awareness of thinking creatively encourages students to develop metacognitive skills and become self-regulated learners.
Arts in the MYP stimulate young imaginations, challenge perceptions and develop creative and analytical skills. Involvement in the arts encourages students to understand the arts in context and the cultural histories of artworks, thus supporting the development of an inquiring and empathetic world view. Arts challenge and enrich personal identity and build awareness of the aesthetic in a real-world context
.
The MYP structures sustained inquiry in arts by developing conceptual understanding in global contexts. Global contexts direct learning towards independent and shared inquiry into our common humanity and shared guardianship of the planet. Using the world as the broadest context for learning, MYP arts can develop meaningful explorations of:
• identities and   relationships
• orientation in   space and time
• personal and cultural   expression
• scientific and   technical innovation
• globalization   and sustainability
• fairness and   development.
MYP Art   Objectives
A  Knowledge and understanding         
Through   the study of theorists and practitioners of the arts, students discover the   aesthetics of art forms and are able to analyse and communicate in   specialized language. Using explicit and tacit knowledge alongside an   understanding of the role of the arts in a global context, students inform   their work and artistic perspectives. 
C   Thinking creatively
The   arts motivate students to develop curiosity and purposefully explore and   challenge boundaries. Thinking creatively encourages students to explore the   unfamiliar and experiment in innovative ways to develop their artistic   intentions, their processes and their work. Thinking creatively enables   students to discover their personal signature and realize their artistic   identity.
B Developing   skills
The   acquisition and development of skills provide the opportunity for active   participation in the art form and in the process of creating art. Skill   application allows students to develop their artistic ideas to a point of   realization. The point of realization could take many forms. However, it is   recognized as the moment when the student makes a final commitment to his or   her artwork by presenting it to an audience. Skills are evident in both   process and product.
D Responding
Students   should have the opportunity to respond to their world, to their own art and   to the art of others. A response can come in many forms; creating art as a   response encourages students to make connections and transfer their learning   to new settings. Through reflecting on their artistic intention and the   impact of their work on an audience and on themselves, students become more   aware of their own artistic development and the role that arts play in their   lives and in the world. Students learn that the arts may initiate change as   well as being a response to change.
The   aims of MYP arts are to encourage and enable students to: 
·
develop skills   specific to the discipline 
·
engage in a   process of creative exploration and (self-)discovery 
·
make purposeful   connections between investigation and practice 
·
and deepen their   understanding of the world.
·
create and   present art 
·
understand the   relationship between art and its contexts 
·
respond to and   reflect on art

As summarized from the IBO MYP Arts Guide and MYP: Principles into Practices
MYP Art aspires to develop creative problem solvers who are caring and responsible individuals, able to respond critically and resourcefully to the demands of a global society and to appreciate the importance of creative expression in all aspects of life. The arts objectives interrelate with each other and form the basis of the student’s experience in the arts. Personal engagement surrounds the student at the centre and connects directly with each of the other objectives.
