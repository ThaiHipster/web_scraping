Jeremy Reese
 I am beginning my 25th year of teaching!  I came to Spring Branch in 2001 after teaching special ed resource and Montessori in Aldine ISD.  In Spring Branch, I have taught sixth, second, fourth, and kindergarten.  I was also a School Improvement Specialist for four years.  This is my third year at WAIS.  I love working with middle schoolers!
I am originally from New Orleans, Louisiana, but I have also lived in Mississippi and in England.  My family has always traveled, and I hope I can share some of my curiosity about our world with my students.  They already know that I love football and car racing!
Please know that I am here to work with families as we support students in having a great year.  Feel free to email with any questions or concerns you might have.  I will make every effort to answer within 24 hours.  Let's have a great year!

 In Reading Lab, we work on becoming stronger readers.  We do this through talking about what we are reading and writing to build comprehension skills and analyze texts in different ways.
Math Lab helps students gain a better understanding of math concepts that are necessary to be successful in higher level mathematics.  We work on basic operations, for example, so that we can transfer and build on that knowledge in other areas. 
In both Reading and Math Lab, instruction is tailored to what each individual student needs through a workshop/menu approach.  This is possible because class sizes are somewhat smaller.  In workshop, we have a quick minilesson, and students work either in groups or individually as I work with a small group on a specific skill or concept.
