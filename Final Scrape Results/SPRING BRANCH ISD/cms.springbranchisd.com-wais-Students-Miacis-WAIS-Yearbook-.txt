Miacis - WAIS Yearbook
The Westchester Annual Publication, ie- the yearbook, now has it's own website.
Please visit 
www.theMiacis.org
 for information about this year's book.
The Miacis
For information about this year's book, please see our website: 
theMiacis.org
In 2005, Westchester Academy chose to return to the original name used from 1967-1984. From the original Westchester High School, in 1967 the yearbook was entitled Miacis. Miacis is an ancient group of extinct mammals, believed to be the ancestors of all modern carnivores, wildcats included.
Miacis is created, designed, and produced by the students on the yearbook staff with guidance and assistance from the campus yearbook advisor. This includes the cover. Many books have a cover designed by a professional or a college student. However, we design our cover's in house using software such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, starting as of 2011.
Can I still get a book from 201X?
We always order extras. Books are available until we sell out. Some years we sell out, some we don't. Once we run out, we run out. Order earlier for lower prices. Prior to 2017, final price for books was $75. As of 2017, final price for books is $80.
Bring payment in cash or check (pay to the order of Westchester Academy) to purchase a book. Or buy a book online at 
theMiacis.org
