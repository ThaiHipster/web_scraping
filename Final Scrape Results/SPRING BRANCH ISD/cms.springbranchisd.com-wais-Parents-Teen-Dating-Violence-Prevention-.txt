Teen Dating Violence Prevention
February is National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. 
National studies show that 1 in 5 teens who have been in a serious relationship report being hit, slapped or pushed by a partner, and 1 in 3 girls who have been in a serious relationship say they’ve been concerned about being physically hurt by their partner. 
Westchester is committed to student safety, and will be educating staff and students in the next few weeks on this issue.  If you would like more information, please check out 
http://www.loveisrespect.org/
 or contact your child’s counselor.
