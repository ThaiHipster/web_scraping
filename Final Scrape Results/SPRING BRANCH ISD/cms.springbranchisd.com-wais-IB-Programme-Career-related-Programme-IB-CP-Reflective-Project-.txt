OVERVIEW
From the IB CP Core Guide.....
Introduction to the Reflective Project
"The reflective project is at the forefront, and the heart, of the core because it encapsulates the fundamental and most important elements of the IB CP. It is what makes the IB CP unique and meaningful in the context of the student’s career-related studies. It embodies each of the aims of the IB CP core that we hope to develop in our students.
From the IB’s perspective, the reflective project allows formal assessment of the student’s development in the two other components of the core, approaches to learning and community and service.
The reflective project is an in-depth body of work produced over an extended period and submitted towards the end of the IB CP. It is the product of the student’s own initiative and should reflect his or her experience of the IB CP. The reflective project is designed to draw together key elements of a student’s wider scheme of study, specifically the career-related studies, community and service and approaches to learning. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual discovery and creativity.
The reflective project investigates and focuses on the ethical dimension of an issue arising from the student’s complementary career-related studies. Students need to identify an issue of interest that they would like to explore in greater depth that arises from their career-related studies. The issue may come to light, for example, in class discussions, through reading or work experience. After selecting an issue, students identify an ethical dilemma associated with the issue and then undertake research on the ethical dilemma, including consultation with the local community. The reflective project is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual discovery and creativity. The end product will highlight the thinking skills and communication skills developed by students in their approaches to learning.
Students begin the reflective project by identifying an issue that comes from their career-related studies. Once the issue has been identified, the student needs to explore the ethical dimension associated with the issue with a focus on an ethical dilemma. It is the ethical dilemma of the issue, and not the issue itself, which is the primary focus of the reflective project."
