STAAR vs. TAKS
End of Course Assessment vs. Multiple Course Testing
STAAR is the current Texas testing program for students in grades 3 through 12, designed to assess progress and to make sure youngsters are on track for graduation and/or college and careers. 
On this site you’ll find updated information for elementary,middle school and high school families about requirements, dates for tests and re-tests, and any changes to the program.You’ll also find FAQs, details about what’s being tested, and information about how the exams impact a student’s promotion to the next grade level.
Still have questions? 
Ask here
. And check back from time to time for updates. The state legislature, through House Bill 5, made significant changes to STAAR in 2013, and it’s possible there may still more adjustments.
TAKS - June 2017 (

Out-of-district (OOD) and out-of-school (OOS) exams
Out-of-district (OOD) and out-of-school (OOS) examinees may now register to take assessments for the December 2017 State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR®) end-of-course (EOC) administration at any participating Texas campus. Refer to the December 2017 End-of-Course Out-of-District and Out-of-School Test Site Directory, available at 
http://texasassessment.com/administrators/test-administration/
, for a list of participating campuses.
Examinees must register online at 
https://forms.texasassessment.com/out-of-district-form/
 for the December 2017 STAAR administration.
The December 2017 STAAR EOC OOD and OOS registration window closes October 6, 2017. The assessments will be administered as follows:

If unregistered OOS examinees arrive for testing at a campus, they must be registered by campus personnel in the STAAR Assessment Management System under the Students > Register tab on the day of testing.

What is student assessment?
Assessment is the process of collecting data for the purposes of specifying and verifying student academic growth and making decisions about students. In SBISD we believe that grading, reporting, and communicating student learning are some of the educators' most important responsibilities to all stakeholders.
