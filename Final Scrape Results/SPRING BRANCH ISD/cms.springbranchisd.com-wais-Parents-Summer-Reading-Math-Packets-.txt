Summer Reading & Math Packets
School Supply Lists, Summer Reading Lists, and Math Packets can be found to the right, divided then sorted by grade. Summer Reading Lists are provided by SBISD, however certain IB courses may expect reading additional books during the summer. 
The Importance of 
Math over Summer
Harris Cooper of Duke University states that all students lose ability in math over the summer, and that this loss is greater than the loss seen in a child's reading and spelling ability over the summer break. He attributes this to less math and computation being part of a child's normal home environment. 
While students not actively engaged in reading over the summer lose reading skill, it is nearly impossible for no reading to occur during the summer simply due to the saturation of written material in our world. However, this is not the case for math- a student can go through all of summer with out any practice in math, thus contributing to larger losses in skill.

The Importance of
Summer Reading
Participation in Summer Reading helps maintain academic gains during the school year. 
In an article on the National Summer Learning Association’s website, James Kim of Harvard University states that providing books with no guidance may not help much at all. But when children get help choosing skill-appropriate books and read those books over the summer break, both independently and with guidance from family members, reading achievement scores can improve significantly.
Kim states that in addition to providing children with reading materials over summer, it is important to also check for comprehension. There are a number of ways to do this, but the most effective are also relatively simple- just ask questions about the story and/or characters and to summarize what they've read so far. Kim has found that without checking for comprehension or approriate to reading level, children show little to no benefit to reading during summer. 
How do we know if a book is at an appropriate skill level for a child? Kim states the easiest way to check is the Five-Finger Rule. Ask the child to read a passage of 100 words from the book, and each time they come across a word that they can't figure out, to raise one finger. If, during the 100-word passage, they raise the fifth finger, than the book is probably too difficult for their level. However, if they find no challenging words, the book may be too easy for them, and may not offer any benefit for them either.
In 2007, in an article on the Reading Rockets website, Mraz and Rasinski state that Access to reading materials has been consistently identified as a vital element in enhancing the reading development of children. Of all the activities in which children engage outside of school, time spent actually reading is the best predictor of reading achievement. 
A 2001 survey of summer reading programs in southern California notes that differences between students who participated in the Summer Reading Program and their non-participating peers were readily apparent.
