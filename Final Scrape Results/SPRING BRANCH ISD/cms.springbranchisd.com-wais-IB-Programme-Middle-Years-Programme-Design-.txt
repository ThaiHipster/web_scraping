IB MYP Design
Design is the link between innovation and creativity, taking thoughts and exploring the possibilities and constraints associated with products or systems, allowing them to redefine and manage the generation of further thought through prototyping, experimentation and adaptation. It is human-centred and focuses on the needs, wants and limitations of the end user.
Competent design is not only within the reach of a small set of uniquely skilled individuals, but can be achieved by all. The use of well-established design principles and processes increases the probability that a design will be successful. To do this, designers use a wide variety of principles which, taken together, make up what is known as the design cycle.
Designing requires an individual to be imaginative and creative, while having a substantial knowledge base of important factors that will aid or constrain the process. Decisions made need to be supported by adequate and appropriate research and investigation. Designers must adopt an approach that allows them to think creatively, while conforming to the requirements of a design specification.
Students develop the skills and attitudes necessary to respond critically and resourcefully to real-life challenges. They question, investigate and evaluate data and information presented. The MYP structures sustained inquiry in design by developing conceptual understanding in global contexts. Global contexts direct learning towards independent and shared inquiry into our common humanity and shared guardianship of the planet. Using the world as the broadest context for learning, MYP design can develop meaningful explorations of:
• identities and   relationships		
• orientation in   space and time		
• personal and   cultural expression		
• scientific and   technical innovation		
• globalization   and sustainability		
• fairness and   development.		
MYP Design courses at WAIS are structured as a series of distinct digital and/or product design courses. Over the five years of MYP, our MYP design courses are designed to use the design cycle to structure projects and work towards meeting the aims and objectives of MYP design. Students complete a design project as a compulsory component of all MYP design courses.
MYP Design Objectives   and Criterion		
There   are four objectives for instruction: 		
Objective A- Inquiring and Analysing		
Objective   B- Developing Ideas		
Objective C- Creating Solutions		
Objective   D- Evaluating 		
Assessment   is based on criterion rubrics using achievement levels with the highest score   being an 8.
Criterion A-
 Inquiring
and 
Analysing		
Criterion B- Developing   Ideas		
Criterion C- Creating   the Solution		
Criterion D-   Evaluating
Note Design Projects- These tasks must be   assessed using all four criteria. It must be presented as a design folder   that is clearly divided into four sections: one per criterion. It must begin   with the student’s inquiry into the problem and end with the evaluation of the   product/solution. Students are presented with a design situation by the   teacher, from which they identify their own problem.

Summarized from the IBO MYP Design Guide and MYP: Principles into Practice
MYP Design requires the use of the design cycle for solving problems and promotes a practical and inquiry-based approach. This helps students to develop not only practical skills but also creative- and critical-thinking strategies. The Design Cycle and a problem-solving approach can also be applied to other subject groups.		
MYP Design includes course in digital design, product design, and combined product/digital design.
