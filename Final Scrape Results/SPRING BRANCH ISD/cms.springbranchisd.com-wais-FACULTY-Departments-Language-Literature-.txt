Language & Literature
Language & Literature
Language and Literature is academically rigorous, and equips students with linguistic, analytical and communicative skills that can also be used in an interdisciplinary manner across all other subject groups. There are six skill areas: listening, speaking, reading, writing, viewing and presenting, which develop as both independent and interdependent skills. The aims are to encourage and enable students to use language as a vehicle for thought, creativity, reflection, learning, self expression and social interaction.

In the IB MYP, students are assessed on an 8-point scale across 4 criteria. The criteria for Language & Literature are 
Analysing, Organizing, Producing Text, and Using Language. We use a standardized chart to convert the 0-8 IB MYP grades into the percentage grades used by Spring Branch. For more information about Language & Literature in the IB MYP, please see the 
Language & Literature Subject Brief
