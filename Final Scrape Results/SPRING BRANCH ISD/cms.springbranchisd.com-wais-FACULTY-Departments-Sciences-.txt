Sciences
MYP Science contributes to the development of students as inquirers, scientifically literate, caring, and responsible individuals who will think critically and creatively when solving problems and making decisions about aspects affecting themselves, others, and their social and nautral environments. Science and its methods of investigation offer a way of learning that contribute to analyitical and critical ways of thinking. Inquiry is at the heart of MYP sciences and aims to support students' understanding of sciences by providing them with opportunities to independently investigate relevant issues through both research and experimentation.

In the IB MYP, students are assessed on an 8-point scale across 4 criteria. In the Sciences, the criteria are Knowing & Understanding, Inquiring & Designing, Processing & Evaluating, and Reflecting on the Impacts of Science. We 
use a standardized chart to convert the 0-8 IB MYP grades into the percentage grades used by Spring Branch. For more information about Sciences in the IB MYP, please see the 
Sciences Subject Brief
