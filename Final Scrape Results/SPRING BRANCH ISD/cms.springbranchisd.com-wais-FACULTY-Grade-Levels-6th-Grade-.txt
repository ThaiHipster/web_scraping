Welcome new Westchester Wildcats! This is a big step for you, not only from one school to another, but from elementary to middle school. Most of you are moving from a neighborhood school near your home, to a district choice offering that provides challenging classes through the IB Middle Years Programme. It may be difficult at times, and you might be nervous, but you have a whole team of teachers ready to help you throughout the year.
In addition to the classes with the three teacher teams in each family, students also have several electives. For elective courses, teacher contact information and locations for course content can be found on the department pages. Students in the Dual Language program are still in one of the two families, but there is a slight difference or two in their schedules.
