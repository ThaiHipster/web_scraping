Membership in the National Junior Honor Society is one of the highest honors that can be awarded to a middle school or junior high school student. The NJHS has worked hard to bring the accomplishments of outstanding students to the attention of parents, teachers, peers, and community. Chapters in more than 5,000 middle level schools across the nation strive to give practical meaning to the Society’s goals of scholarship, leadership, service, citizenship, and character.
These five ideals were considered as the basis for selection. No student is inducted simply because of a high academic average. The National Junior Honor Society strives to recognize the total student: one who excels in all areas.The NJHS motto is 
Light Is the Symbol of Truth.

NJHS Standards
 Currently in Grade 7 (semester 2), 8, or 9
Scholarship - The national minimum standard for scholarship shall be a cumulative scholastic average of at least 85 percent, B, or 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) or the equivalent standard of excellence. Candidates shall then be evaluated on the basis of service, leadership, character, and citizenship as demonstrated by activities, teacher recommendations and evaluations.
(Please
 note that a child may not have any N's in conduct. Our process is cumulative from the first semester of 6th grade. After it is determined that a child meets the grade and conduct expectations, then a faculty council completes the screening process. Finally, when a child meets all these steps, they are invited to join the National Junior Honor Society.)
