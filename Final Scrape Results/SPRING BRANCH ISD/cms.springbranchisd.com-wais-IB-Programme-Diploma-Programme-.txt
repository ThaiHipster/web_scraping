Mission Statements
The Mission of 
Westchester Academy for International Studies is to provide a challenging and varied 
       curriculum in which all students can succeed. The curriculum will develop an international 
       awareness (consciousness) including a focus on international relations and international 
       problem solving, to create a love of learning
 and emphasize good citizenship.
The 
International Baccalaureate aims to develop inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people who
       help to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and 
       respect.  
To this end the organization works with schools, governments and international 
       organizations to develop challenging programmes of international education and rigorous 
       assessment.  
These programmes encourage students across the world to become active, 
       compassionate and lifelong learners who understand that other people, with their differences, 
       can also be right.

Earning the IB Diploma 
IB courses are offered at Standard Level (SL) or Higher Level (HL).  Higher Level classes involve more hours of class instruction, taught over two years, and include an extra study option not found in Standard Level courses.
For the IB Diploma, students take 3, no more than 4, courses at Higher Level.  The other 2 or 3 courses are taken at Standard Level.  Students take one class from each Group.  For the Bilingual Diploma, students take 2 different languages in Group 1 and no language in Group 2.  Instead of taking a course in Group 6, students may take a second course from Groups 2, 3, or 4.
In addition to the six courses, Diploma students complete the following coursework: Theory of Knowledge, Extended Essay of 4,000 words, and CAS (Creativity, Action, Service).
