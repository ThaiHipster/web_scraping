Music
The TAPA Music Program offers a wide array of musical experiences and opportunities with a focus on individual skill building, group collaboration and community performances.
In Lower School (7th - 8th grade), students receive an introduction to music performance using keyboards, drums, xylophones, voices and guitars. We study various musical genres, create original drum beats and lyrics and consider the role music plays in our community and our world. 
In Upper School (9th - 12th grade) Music Majors receive two periods of music instruction every day. Arts Block focus on theory, history, composition, improvisation, songwriting, ear training and general musicianship. Arts Practicum provides an opportunity for students to take private instrument lessons and develop their instrumental or vocal skills. 
Students may also enroll in the following after school ensembles: Chorus, Percussion Ensemble, Brass Band, MARS Camp (Songwriting + Recording)
