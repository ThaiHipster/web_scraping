	WORLD LANGUAGES
The World Languages Department is committed to offering a technology- based program with the aim of meeting the needs of students regardless of their ability.  We recognize that the level of proficiency each pupil attains may be different therefore, flexibility is built into the program. Every offering has objectives to develop listening, speaking, reading and writing skills, although emphasis may be different from course to course. The department offers sequences in French and Spanish.
SPANISH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE
Michaela McCaughey, Spanish Language Instructor
Ms.McCaughey@TAPAprovidence.org
Michaela’s journey to TAPA began in 2004, during her junior year at the University of Rhode Island, when she studied abroad in Argentina. That short semester changed everything for her. She returned to URI to finish her studies, double majoring in philosophy and Spanish, but part of her never left Argentina. After graduating, she moved to Buenos Aires with no plans, no job, and nowhere to live. She worked various odd jobs and made connections there, cementing her love for Latin America. From there, she lived in Spain and Chile, learning variations within the language and culture. She holds a master's degree in Spanish translation and interpretation from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California, and she has worked as a Spanish interpreter in major hospitals in Boston and Providence. Completely infatuated with reggaetón, bachata, and all things Shakira, Michaela seeks to not simply “teach Spanish,” but to celebrate Hispanic culture, art, and language, and to ignite the desire to learn by immersion, no matter the topic, in each of her students.
