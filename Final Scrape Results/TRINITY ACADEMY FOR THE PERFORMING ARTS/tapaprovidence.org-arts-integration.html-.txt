	Arts Integration
Arts Integration
At TAPA, students will be taught utilizing a fully-integrated arts curriculum, where students learn math, english, science and history through
 drama, film, music and dance. At TAPA we use Arts Integration to affirm the indispensability of the arts as a core curriculum subject, and view the arts as a catalyst to learn other subjects.
This pyramid shows the levels of Arts Integration that TAPA uses in all of our classes.
Traditional art education exists in the bottom of each pyramid, with the arts and academics being entirely independent from one another.
At TAPA, only 10-20% of our class time is spent in the "Independent" section of the pyramid. 
Our goal is to create classrooms where the arts are, at very least, a catalyst for the other academic subjects, if not fundamentally interconnected or indispensable.
TAPA prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, creed, sex, age, marital status, national origin, mental or physical disability, political affiliation, veteran status, sexual orientation, genetic information and any other class of individuals protected from discrimination under state or federal law.
