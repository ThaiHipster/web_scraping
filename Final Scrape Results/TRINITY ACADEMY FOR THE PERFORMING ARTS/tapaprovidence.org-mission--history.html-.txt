MissioN, History & FAQ's
Mission Statement 
Through a rigorous arts-integrated program, TAPA, a public charter school in Providence, Rhode Island, cultivates artist-scholars who are prepared for collegiate and professional success and leadership in a global society.
TAPA develops well-rounded, educated, artistic and professional community leaders who practice service and teamwork in initiating and implementing goals, with a focus on the global society.
Trinity Academy for the Performing Arts is an academically-rigorous, arts-integrated public charter school for students in grades 7-12. TAPA is a community of practice, where culture, the performing arts and an expanded learning time are all fundamental components of a rigorous academic program. TAPA is woven into the diverse and creative fabric of the city of Providence, fostering engaged, well-rounded artistic leaders.
History 
At its core, TAPA is a product of the SouthSide of Providence, RI. In 2007, TAPA's founders pulled together a series of community charrettes, asking the people of the SouthSide what the neighborhood most needed. The group who met that day took it as their mission to break the cycle of “parents from economically distressed districts" who "just take what they can get or are given by the [school] system" rather than "feel empowered to demand the best educational preparation for their children, or to influence the depth, breadth and variety of academic offerings within their children‘s schools or classrooms (Stevos, 2008).”
The idea for TAPA was wildly ambitious: opening a new school in a community that had seen its neighborhood school shuttered, with a focus on the Arts, which were all-but-ignored by Providence Public Schools. The plan was derided in some RI education circles: Without a heavy-lifting power-player or substantial outside backing, how could this pie-in-the-sky community project get off the ground? However, with hard work and determination, Team TAPA persevered and Trinity Academy for the Performing Arts opened in the fall of 2010 with our first class of 34 seventh-grade students. Now at capacity, TAPA serves 220 students in grades seven through twelve.
Founder and Board President Emeritus: Dr. Joyce Stevos
 TAPA is the brainchild of Dr. Joyce Louise Caldwell Stevos.  Dr. Stevos is a Rhode Island native, a graduate of Classical High School, and has earned a Bachelor and Masters degree from Rhode Island College and a doctorate from the University of Rhode Island/Rhode Island College Joint Program in Education. She is also an adjunct professor in Educational Studies at Rhode Island College.
As a teacher and supervisor of Social Studies in the Providence Public Schools, Dr. Stevos was a leader in implementing the study of Black History, the Holocaust, the Armenian Genocide, and law-related education. She was the primary designer of the Government and Law Magnet at Central high School and the Teacher Academy at Mt. Pleasant High School. Dr. Stevos was the Director of Strategic Planning and Professional Development in the Providence Public Schools where she worked with teachers and administrators to begin and implement the first wave of educational reform in the District.
For 25 years, Dr. Stevos worked with different publishing companies in writing and critiquing history and civics texts for middle and high school students. After retiring from the Providence School Department Dr. Stevos worked as a consultant with Trinity Restoration, Inc to develop and incorporate Trinity Academy for the Performing Arts Charter School. Dr. Stevos was president of the Board for 7 years.
In giving back to the community, Dr. Stevos has served as President of the Urban League of RI, was an incorporator and officer of the Rhode Island Black Heritage Society, and has served on the Boards of the Providence Public Library, the Providence Preservation Society, the Heritage Harbor Board and the Rhode Island Board of Education. She is a member and past Regent of the Narragansett-Cooke-Gaspee Chapter of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution, the Boards of the Heritage Hall of Fame and the Heritage Harbor Foundation.
Dr. Stevos has been recognized by many community groups for her contributions to education and the Rhode Island Community. In 1992 she was named a Milken National Educator from Rhode Island and in 2014 received the Classical Distinguished Alumni Award.  
Frequently Asked Questions

TAPA stands for Trinity Academy for the Performing Arts. We are a public charter school located on the West End of Providence, Rhode Island.

So, while we are not affiliated with fabulous Trinity Rep, our programs share the same roots.

TAPA is a 7-12 public middle/high school. We accept between 34-40 students per grade level, and serve a total of 220 students.

What is a charter school? 
Charter schools are public schools. They are authorized by the State of Rhode Island to operate independently from some state and local district rules and regulations. As a result of this flexibility, charter school operations are allowed to pursue innovative educational strategies designed to meet specific student achievement goals and the objectives stated in their charter. Charter schools are publicly-funded, therefore they are tuition free.
What district does TAPA belong to?
TAPA is an independent public charter school and does not belong to any district. It is considered its own district and because of this is listed as an LEA (Local Education Agency) by the RI Department of Education. TAPA has its own Board similar to the towns' and cities' school boards.
Does TAPA follow the same regulations as other public schools?
TAPA follows all of the regulations that the Department of Education requires of public schools. This means that, among other things, TAPA's teachers are all qualified to teach their subject in the state of RI and TAPA students take the state PARCC exams.
Is there transportation available for students?
A school bus is provided for Lower School (grades 7-8) students who live a 1.5 miles or more from TAPA; a RIPTA bus pass is provided for Upper School (grades 9-12) students who live 2 miles or more from TAPA.
