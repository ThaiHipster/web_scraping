Governing Board Guidelines for Public Comment During Board Meetings
The Trinity Academy for the Performing Arts Charter School Governing Board welcomes public comment during most regular meetings. Generally, Governing Board members do not respond to public comment during the meeting. Governing Board members regularly review letters and emails sent to the Governing Board.
Time – Each speaker may speak for up to three minutes. A timer will be used and speakers should conclude their remarks when the buzzer sounds. 
Topics – Speakers may address an item on a Governing Board agenda or may address an item not on the agenda during the time provided for Public Comment. All comments should address a matter related to Trinity Academy for the Performing Arts Charter School. The Governing Board will not hear public comment that involves a complaint about an individual staff member, a student disciplinary matter, a complaint about an individual student, or pending litigation. Such matters should be reduced to writing and sent to the Board President.
Decorum – The Governing Board expects that each speaker will be courteous, modeling for our students how one can respectfully disagree with others’ views. Speakers will address their comments to the entire Governing Board and not to one individual Board member, nor to the Head of School, to a staff member, nor to the audience. Speakers will not engage in personal attacks.
Signing up to Speak – Speakers may request to be added to the speakers list by signing up in the TAPA main office or on the sign-up sheet available at the start of every Board Meeting. Speakers are called in the order in which they sign up. Speakers may not speak more than once on a specific topic. Any person who would like an interpreter to assist them in providing public comment and any person with a disability who needs accommodation to provide public comment should notify the TAPA Office at least three business days in advance of a meeting to request assistance.
Written Comments – If a speaker would like to present written comments to the Governing Board, fourteen copies should be provided.
TAPA Board Members
Founders: Joyce Stevos and Richardson Ogidan
Amanda Woodward, President
Amanda Woodward moved from the outskirts of Los Angeles to Providence with her husband 14 years ago in search of the community spirit that she had experienced growing up in the Midwest.  She loves the access to beaches and amazing cultural experiences in food and arts, but most of all she loves living in a neighborhood where everyone knows each other and stops to chat it up on the street. With an electrical engineering degree, she started out as an automation engineer then pursued technical management which led her through a variety of experiences in research, design and manufacturing of automation equipment, toys and machine components, culminating in reaching her goal as VP of Research and Product Development for a technology company.  Working for both privately-owned small companies and internationally-owned large companies has exposed her to a wide breadth of challenges that she enjoyed overcoming.
Eventually, Ms. Woodward acted on her dream to own a business and bought a graphics design and printing shop in Wakefield.  This enabled her to be involved with community activities.  She joined the Wakefield Rotary Club and later joined the fledgling board of Contemporary Theater Company.  With her zest to believe with determination anything is possible, she helped to transition the theater group in 2012 into a permanent space where it continues to thrive. Recently she sold her business so that she has time to become involved with more community activities closer to home while working as an engineering consultant.,

Michaela McCaughey, Staff Representative (voting) 
Michaela’s journey to TAPA began in 2004, during her junior year at the University of Rhode Island, when she studied abroad in Argentina. That short semester changed everything for her. She returned to URI to finish her studies, double majoring in philosophy and Spanish, but part of her never left Argentina. After graduating, she moved to Buenos Aires with no plans, no job, and nowhere to live. She worked various odd jobs and made connections there, cementing her love for Latin America. From there, she lived in Spain and Chile, learning variations within the language and culture. She holds a master's degree in Spanish translation and interpretation from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California, and she has worked as a Spanish interpreter in major hospitals in Boston and Providence. Completely infatuated with reggaetón, bachata, and all things Shakira, Michaela seeks to not simply “teach Spanish,” but to celebrate Hispanic culture, art, and language, and to ignite the desire to learn by immersion, no matter the topic, in each of her students.
Kevin Cordeiro, Staff Representative (non-voting)
Kevin is excited to be part of the TAPA Ensemble and the Historical Perspective and Lower School teams. He received his BA from Rhode Island College and is currently pursuing a Master's Degree in History focusing on the new cultural history of the Latin and Lusophone world. This cultural focus intertwines the arts into the history of the people of the world, and delves into how the arts represent and effect society. Outside of teaching and history, Kevin works on restoring cars and motorcycles. He has grown up as a fan and now is an (amateur) creator of pop culture, comics, and horror.
