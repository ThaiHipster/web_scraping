Theatre
The Theatre program at TAPA is designed to teach, train and inspire youth with the history, theory and practice of the art of play. The program teaches both theatrical education and real world application of the art and pushes the students to use theatre as an outlet to express themselves and gain skills, professionalism and confidence. 
Students will be given an introduction to the theatre arts and will study the history of theatre from early Egyptian and Greek theatre, to the classical Shakespearean theatre to modern day theatre.
Students will be taught the following: 
Monologue Performance
Interview and Presentation Skills
Classical and Modern Acting
Character Study & Analysis
Play Analysis
Producing
Budgeting
Directing
Script Writing
Stage Managing
Costume Design
Lighting Design
Set Design and Construction
Musical Theatre
International Theatre
Experimental Theatre
The Greek Chorus
Vaudeville Performance
Improv
Stage Combat
Whether a student goes on to continue the art form after high school or use the skills in their future career outside of theatre, they will leave TAPA feeling more prepared for a career in the performing arts, a liberal arts education or even general life skills.
