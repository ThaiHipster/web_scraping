ARIZONA TAX CREDIT DONATING TO SCHOOL
AT NO COST TO YOU
As a taxpayer, you initiate a school contribution, and Arizona pays the bill? What a deal? This article, in question and answer format, will give you the fine points on how the tax credit works, and how you can donate money to a school’s activities, which are out of the normal day at no cost to you. Here are the clubs and extracurricular activities for students (listed in alphabetical order) that can be chosen to designate your tax credit contribution to. Sports, music, art, and field trips are all included separately on the tax credit form, therefore, not listed here.
