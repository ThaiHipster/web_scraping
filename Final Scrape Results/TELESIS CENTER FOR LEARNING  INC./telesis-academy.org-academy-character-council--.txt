Character Council is a group of Telesis students recommended by their teachers to initiate and provide good character projects, activities and programs to set a culture of good character on the Telesis Campus and in the community. Telesis Preparatory Academy is a Character First school utilizing the Character First character education program.
Character Council is a student driven organization and is made up of students who have consistently demonstrated the character qualities emphasized by the Character First Program.  Members help the staff foster and recognize exemplary character traits on the Telesis campus. A Character Council, a student organization with a representative from each classroom (K-12) in which all student representatives (including the developmental kindergarten students), meet together and have input and vote on all issues.
We include character instruction and training at Telesis Preparatory Academy for two reasons:
1. To follow the dictates of our conscience as to what makes an excellent educational center and
2. To follow the Arizona state standards, which promotes character education.
