STAR Literacy Assessment Overview
Assessment Value
STAR Enterprise assessments dynamically adjust to each student’s unique responses,pinpointing student achievement levels quickly and efficiently. These assessments allow for review of scores in a variety of formats to help with planning for instruction and intervention.
Student Growth Percentiles
STAR Assessments are the first interim assessments to report Student Growth Percentiles—to more accurately gauge growth by comparing student progress relative to students of similar achievement levels, and reports the results as a percentile.
Displayed on an interactive, web-based growth proficiency chart, STAR Assessments’ Student Growth Percentiles are viewable by district, school, grade, or class. In addition to Student Growth Percentiles, the Growth Report displays other key growth indicators such as grade equivalency, percentile rank, and instructional reading level.
Using the classroom GPC, school administrators and teachers can better identify best practices that are having a significant educational impact on student growth.
Core Progress
Learning progressions define the pathway of how students typically advance knowledge in a particular subject area.
STAR Enterprise short-cycle interim assessments are the first to use the Core Progress learning progressions for math and reading. With Core Progress, learning progressions are no longer an assumption, but empirically validated pathways of learning.
Core Progress’ web-based portal allows educators to better understand content-area vocabulary, conceptual knowledge, how to support English learners, as well as prerequisite skills needed for mastery. Core Progress:
Supports and helps educators bridge assessment and instruction
Charts a path forward and provides instructional resources
Maps prerequisite skills and illustrates how complexity of thought evolves
Delivers tangible steps toward meeting state standards and CCSS
