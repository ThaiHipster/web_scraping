Hello Telesis Parents and Staff!
The Parents Who Care Group and the Telesis Booster Club have merged. This idea came up as a way to consolidate efforts between parents, teachers, students and staff to have the best impact possible for our kids. It was determined that both groups had a similar focus and by working together we hope we can do more and enlarge our membership. We are the Telesis Parent Teacher Booster Club or the Telesis PTBC. Our meetings are held the 1st Thursday of each month, at 5:30pm in the Telesis Library. Childcare will be available.
 We have discussed a lot of new ideas and projects we are hoping to roll out this year. Our kids at Telesis work hard and need some fun activities to look forward to in the future. We will continue Fun Fridays one to two times per month. The PTBC Fun Friday activities are available to all of the student body at no extra cost. Please Note: On occasion, school clubs will have a special fundraiser and those dress up days cost $1.
We have a lot of great ideas and the more ambassadors or helpers we have, the more we are able to do! So please come to our next meeting and see how you can be involved or let us know if you are interested in planning an event or being on a committee for an event. 
Thanks so much and here is to a happy and healthy new school year!
What is PTBC?
PTBC stands for Parent Teacher Booster Club. We are a community of parental and volunteer support. Our goal is to build a group of parents and teachers who are committed to bettering the learning environment for staff and most importantly, for supporting students and student athletes. 
A main focus is ambassadorship. In other words, PTBC is a voice for Telesis to help spread the word about the great things Telesis has to offer.

Volunteer in the classroom (with fingerprint clearance)
Volunteer at various school events and PTBC committees
