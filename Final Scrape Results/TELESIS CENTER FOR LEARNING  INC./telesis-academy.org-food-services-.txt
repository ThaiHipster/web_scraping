Dear Parent/Guardian:
Children need healthy meals to learn. Telesis Center For Learning, Inc. offers healthy meals every school day. Due to the high costs of food services, we are sorry to say starting 2016-2017 school year, we will no longer be able to offer free meals for all students. This packet includes an application for free or reduced-price meal benefits, as well as a set of detailed instructions.
Your children may qualify for free meals or for reduced-price meals.
REDUCED Price IS $0.30 FOR BREAKFAST, AND $0.40 FOR LUNCH.
FULL PAY IS $1.55 FOR BREAKFAST, AND $2.80 FOR LUNCH.
PLEASE SET UP YOUR ON-LINE PAYMENT OPTION PRIOR TO THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL. INFORMATION/INSTRUCTIONS ON E-FUNDS (ON-LINE PAYMENT OPTION) WILL BE AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE HOMEPAGE: WWW.TELESIS-ACADEMY.ORG BY AUGUST 3RD. PLEASE USE YOUR STUDENT ID NUMBER TO REGISTER. CASH PAYMENT WILL BE ACCEPTED AS WELL.
Your cooperation is appreciated. We need 100% of all applications to be returned within 30 days in order to be able to offer this program to our students. An income application which does not contain the requested information cannot be processed by the school.
Please fill out the application and return it to Telesis Center For Learning, Inc. Applications can be returned to the Main Office Building A Monday-Friday 7:15am until 3:30pm.
Only one application per household is required listing all children.
Again – we need 100% of applications returned.
If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call (928)855-8661 x114.
Si tiene preguntas, por favor llame al teléfono (928) 855-8661 x114.
Sincerely,
Ellen Went
Administrative Assist.
