Tristen Roberge is Student of the Month for October!
Congratulations to our October Student of the Month, Tristen Roberge!
Tristen’s favorite classes are math, English, and science.  She also enjoys drawing, writing, and participating in Art Club.  Her teachers said, “Tristen is new to Telesis this year and she is just a joy!  She works very hard, frequently going above and beyond.  She s always on task, is helpful to others, has a great sense of humor, and has good common sense.  When completing work, she is thorough and pays attention to details.  Tristen clearly cares about her education and success.”
Way to go!
