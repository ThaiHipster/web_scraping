Brandi Bernardino-DeLaPaz is Student of the Month for November!
Congratulations for being selected as November’s Student of the Month, Brandi Bernardino-DeLaPaz!
Brandi enjoys math class and practicing karate.  She is especially proud of earning a yellow belt in karate and making honor roll.  Her teachers said, “She is such a kind and conscientious student.   Brandi is always on task, puts forth full effort in everything she does, and is willing to participate in all classroom activities.  She is very conscientious about alerting teachers to an absence and making up work.  She is a joy to have in the classroom and all of her teachers are very proud of her accomplishments.”
Fantastic job!
