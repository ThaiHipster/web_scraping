School Communication
    To help communicate better with you on all school events, we use an internet communication program that sends out e-mails. This will include information about classroom and school wide events, as well as important WCC updates; to ensure you have the most current information from us. We will continue to send home letters with students with this information, however, we realize that often times, it is misplaced or doesn’t make it home to you. Receiving it in your e-mail box ensures that you see everything.
    In order to do this, we need your e-mail addresses to update our contact database. By giving your e-mail to us, we WILL NOT provide it to anyone for marketing or any other purpose. This will ONLY be used for communication about WCC and your students.
