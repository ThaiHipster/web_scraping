Transportation
                Parents are responsible for transporting students to and from school on time.  There is no bus service available at this time. If a student is tardy or is leaving school prior to discharge time, the parent / guardian must sign the attendance log in the office.  If a student is to be transported by a person not on the approved list on the enrollment application, a written notice or phone call must be given to the office prior to the student’s departure.            
                During drop-off and pick-up times, do not leave your car unattended, as this will block the flow of traffic and becomes a dangerous situation on Willow Creek Road. If you need to get out of your car, please pull into a parking space.            
                WE STRICTLY ADHERE TO DROP OFF AND PICK UP TIMES. Students may not arrive on campus before 7:45 a.m. and must be picked up by 4:00p.m.  Parents that arrive after 4:05 will be charged $1.00 a minute, as WCC does not have after school care.  Please be on time!            
                Students who are walking and/or riding bikes to and from school require a written note on the student application with parent permission.

Lunches
                Students bring their own packed lunch for snacks and lunch each day, as we do not have a cafeteria or meal delivery. Microwaves are not available for heating food up, so put hot food in a thermos if needed. Please pack your child a nutritious snack and lunch, so they are the best they can be all day!
