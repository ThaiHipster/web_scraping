Southwest Leadership Academy
    Child Find Policy  
As determined by the state and federal government, every school is required to have a process that allows them to determine if a student needs special education services or any related services. At Southwest Leadership Academy, we have a process that is designed to evaluate students (at the permission or request of the parent) and have professionals working in and in conjunction with the school provide a plan that will allow them to be on track academically.
The purpose of this notice is to describe: (1) the types of disabilities that might qualify the child for such programs and services, (2) the special education programs and related services that are available, (3) the process by which the public schools screen and evaluate such students to determine eligibility, (4) the special rights that pertain to such children and their parents or legal guardians and (5) the confidentiality rights that pertain to student information.
