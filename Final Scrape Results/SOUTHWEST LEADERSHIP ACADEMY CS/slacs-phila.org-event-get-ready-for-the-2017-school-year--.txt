« Southwest Leadership Academy welcomes Principal Leigh Purnell!
PSSA Testing Reduced by 20% »
Dear family and friends of Southwest Leadership Academy Charter School,
We are thrilled for the upcoming school year. We have had a busy summer getting everything prepared for fall. We have welcomed a new Chief Academic Officer and Principal by the name of Ms. Leigh Purnell who comes to our organization with a wealth of experience. We have been approved by the School District of Philadelphia for renewal for another 5 years and will soon be able to grow our school community. We just had a few important reminders for you:
Parent Orientation
Parent Orientation provides an opportunity to learn about important initiatives for the upcoming school year and meet SLA’s faculty, staff, and administration. Please make all necessary arrangements to attend.
Parents K-4 – Monday August 28th at 5:00 pm

Uniforms
