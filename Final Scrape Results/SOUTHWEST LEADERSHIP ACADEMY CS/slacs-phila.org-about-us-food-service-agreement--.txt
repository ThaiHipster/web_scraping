Southwest Leadership Academy
    Breakfast & Lunch Program  
Lintons Food Service Management serves as Southwest Leadershipâ€™s official food service provider. In order to ensure the highest level of service, Lintons has revamped their website. Through collaboration with food service directors, government agencies, school nutrition specialists, and industry professionals, they have provided a comprehensive website. The website is focused on nutrition and fitness, and includes nutrition calculators and tools as well as videos for use by school staff and parents. This also allows for the management of menu postings with nutritional facts.
