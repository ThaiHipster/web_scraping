Southwest Leadership Academy
    Our Founders  
In 2005, the founders of Southwest Leadership Academy Charter School set out to create an educational institution that would develop leaders in Southwest Philadelphia through a rigorous educational experience. Throughout the narrative of this application, the school highlighted the lack of access in the region which would lead to students being essentially “trapped in (local) poorly-performing public schools.” In the ten years since, Southwest Leadership Academy has been able to consistently offer an educational option that meets this goal. The founders of the organization continue to play a valuable role in the organization.
