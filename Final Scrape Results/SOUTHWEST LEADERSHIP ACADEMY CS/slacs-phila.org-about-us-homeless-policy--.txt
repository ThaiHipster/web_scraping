    Homeless Policy  
By law, schools must allow a homeless child/youth to enroll in school immediately, even if you have no school records, proof of residency, or any other documentation.  The school will then assist you in obtaining the required documents once the child is enrolled.  Additional brochures and information is available at the schools main office.
