Priscilla Gray
			3rd Grade Teacher
Welcome to the 2017-2018 school year!  My name is Mrs. Gray and I will be your 3rd grade teacher.  I am so excited about the amazing year we have ahead of us.  I have so much planned and can’t wait to get started!  
I have been married for 12 years and have one daughter who will be starting 5th grade this year.  We also have 2 very cute shelter dogs named Tiana and Roxie.  As a family we enjoy camping, cooking, going on short road trips, watching movies and love spending Saturday mornings at Barnes & Noble.
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns you may have.
