All board meetings are open to the public.  Under the following circumstances, Texas law permits the board to go into a closed session:  to discuss prospective gifts or donations, real property acquisition, personnel issues including conferences with employees and employee complaints, security matters, student discipline, or to consult with attorneys.
As a convenience to the members of the community, we will post the agendas of each school board meeting on the District's web site.  Due to technical errors or delays, there may be times when the agenda is not posted on the web site prior to the actual meeting.  However, in accordance to state law, there will always be a physical posting of the agenda at the District offices prior to the school board meeting.  The official minutes of board meetings are also posted to the District's web site after they are formally approved by the board at the following meeting.
For more information, please call our administration office at (940) 383-6655.
