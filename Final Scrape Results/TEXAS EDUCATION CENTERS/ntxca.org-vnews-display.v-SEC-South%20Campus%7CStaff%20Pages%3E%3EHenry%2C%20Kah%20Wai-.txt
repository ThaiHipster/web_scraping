Hello and welcome to First Grade! My name is Mrs. Henry and this is my second year as the first grade teacher at North Texas Collegiate Academy, Lewisville.
I am originally from the United Kingdom, but have traveled the world as part of my teaching career of over 20 years. I have taught in the UK, Singapore, Malaysia, and the USA. In 2015, I relocated from California with my family.  Although I miss the sunny southern Californian climate, and the beautiful beaches, I am now enjoying a calmer pace of life here in Texas!
Most of my career has been teaching early elementary children. I love this age group as they are enthusiastic to learn and show huge growth both personally and academically over the course of the year.
I would like to work closely together with you for the success of your child’s development. Communication is the key to a great partnership. Please contact me if you have any questions, concerns or want to share some information about your child. My email address is kahwai.henry@ntxca.org.
