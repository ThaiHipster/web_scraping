Randy Tates
 Music Teacher 
Welcome to Music and P.E. I am the Music and P.E. teacher here at the south campus. I have been teaching music for over 10 years. I have played with various bands and also owned a few local bands around the Dallas metro area. Your child will be learning the fundamentals of music, the theatrical side of music and participating in skits. They will learn that music and theatrics can take them anywhere they want to go in life. In P.E. our students will learn all fundamentals of sports. For example, how to properly work out,stretch and how to be a team player.
