			Pre-Kindergarten Paraprofessional 
Welcome to NTCA! This is my first year and I'm excited to be apart of the team here and work for your students success. 
I'm a native Texan and grew up in Dallas. 
My husband and I have two beautiful daughters. Our oldest, Marsha lives in North Carolina and is expecting her first son this fall. Our youngest, Nina was recently married In December. Nina is in her fifth year of being a special education teacher. 
In my free time I enjoy camping and traveling. On weekends when the weather is cool, you can find me in the backyard gardening. I love to go to flea markets and antique malls.
