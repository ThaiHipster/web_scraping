A Brief Look At The History Of  North Texas Collegiate Academy
The sponsoring entity of 
North Texas Collegiate Academy
 is Salvaging Teens At-Risk, STAR, Inc. located at 4601 N. I-35, Denton, TX 76207.  STAR, Inc. is an organization exempt from taxation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. Section 501(c) 3].  The organization was chartered in Texas as a non-profit corporation on September 18, 1997 to serve youth who found themselves in situations that impeded their ability to succeed in traditional educational settings.   We now serve students in all academic arenas in grades K-8.  Our program is centered around 3 components:
    1. Character education,
    2. Community service, and
    3. College readiness.
On November 3, 2000, the Texas State Board of Education voted unanimously to allow the opening of two charter school campuses. We have now grown to three campuses in Denton, Lewisville, and Little Elm. Because 
North Texas Collegiate Academy
 is a public charter school funded by the Texas State Board of Education, there is no charge for tuition. We currently serve students in kindergarten through 8th grade.  
NTCA proudly serves students who reside in the following school districts:
    Lewisville, Carrollton-Farmers Branch, Little Elm, Lake Dallas, Celina, Prosper,     Aubrey, Pilot Point, Ponder, Krum, Sanger, Denton, and Argyle.
