			5th & 6th Math/Science Teacher 
I am excited to be your 5th and 6th grade math and science teacher for the 2017-2018 school year!  This is my second year in education, and I am looking forward to another successful school year filled with learning and growing. 
I have been married for 5 years, and have two daughters.  My oldest will be starting 5th grade this year, and my youngest is 1.  My family enjoys sports, being outside and active, reading, and playing games.
