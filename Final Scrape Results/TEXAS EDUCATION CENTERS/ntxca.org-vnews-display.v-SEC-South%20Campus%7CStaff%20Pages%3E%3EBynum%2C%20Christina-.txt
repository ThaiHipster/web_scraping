Christina Bynum
			7th & 8th ELA/Soc.St. Teacher 
Hello!  My name is Christina Bynum and I am the 7th and 8th Grade ELA and Social Studies teacher at the NTCA-South campus. This will be my 10th year teaching at NTCA.  I love learning and I am looking forward to sharing that passion with my students.  I enjoy reading, crossword puzzles, cooking, and spending time with my family and my dog, Nikon.  I am excited to start another year of teaching and working with my students!
Please check my webpage periodically as I will add information throughout the year.
