AIMS Testing
AIMS
Arizona’s Instrument to Measure Standards (AIMS) is a standardized test administered by the state of Arizona. AIMS is a standards based assessment aligned to the Arizona Academic Content Standards.
All Arizona public school students in grades 3 through 8 and 10 are required to take the AIMS test. The AIMS test includes four content areas: writing, reading, mathematics, and science. The reading and mathematics content areas are administered in all grades. The writing content area is administered in grades 5, 6, 7, and 10. The science content area is administered in grades 4, 8, and 10.
To graduate from an Arizona public high school, a student must meet the AIMS High School Graduation Requirement. The most common way to meet this requirement is to pass the writing, reading, and mathematics content areas of the AIMS HS test. High school students have multiple opportunities to take and pass these content areas. For students who do not pass all three required content areas of the AIMS HS test, there are alternative methods for meeting the AIMS High School Graduation requirement.
