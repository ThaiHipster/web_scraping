Student Pre-Enrollment Form
APPLICATIONS WILL BE PROCESSED ON A FIRST-COME FIRST-SERVE BASIS
ALL NEW PARENTS MUST ATTEND A NEW-PARENT ORIENTATION MEETING
This is a 
Pre-Enrollment form, by filling this out it holds your place for the following school year. You will receive a letter telling you when to come in to fill out Enrollment forms.
Completion of the pre-registration form is a reservation for a spot but not a guarantee; we must ensure there is space available in the grade you have requested.  The registrar for the school will call you and verify availability. If space is available, enrollment will be complete once all documents have been received upon your scheduled visit at the school and signed off on.
