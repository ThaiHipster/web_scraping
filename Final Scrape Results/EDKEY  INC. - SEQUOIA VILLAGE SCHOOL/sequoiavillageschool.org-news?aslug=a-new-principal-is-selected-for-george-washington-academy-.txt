A new principal is selected for George Washington Academy
				Posted On: 2017-11-09 03:22 PM
				Jamie Beth Kulish of Show Low has been selected for the position of principal at George Washington Academy in Snowflake.  Beth was the Assistant Principal at Sequoia Village School prior to this appointment.  She is a strong academic leader who graduated from Northern Arizona University.  This is her 10th year in education and she has taught Kindergarten - 3rd grade at Sequoia Village School and was the lead teacher from 2014-2016.  She was also the Teacher Mentor for SVS and GWA from 2016-2017.  Prior to teaching, she owned and operated Kulish Clubhouse Child Care and Preschool in which she earned a caregiver award.  As a teacher, Beth was nominated and chosen for the 2016 Arizona Diamondbacks Most Valuable Teacher award.  She is also the advisor for the Junior Optimist Club and has been a Girl Scout leader, as well as created many community partners at both SVS and GWA.   Beth helped start a Peer Mentoring class at Sequoia Village and George Washington Academy.   Most recently, Beth was nominated for the Sequoia Root Award which recognizes the staff member with the most positive change for their school.
Beth is also a licensed Zumba Instructor and has incorporated Zumba as an Elective Class at GWA as well as being part of morning live assemblies to get the students energized for the day.  She also teaches evening classes at the Gym in Show Low and Pinetop.
Beth's favorite thing to do is watch her son Kyson and daughter Mikenzie play sports and participate in extracurricular activities with her husband Shaun.  She looks forward to working with the amazing students and their families as well as the staff from George Washington Academy and strives to promote communication, differentiation, and patriotism, and ensure that every child is known.
