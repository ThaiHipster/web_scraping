About SVS
“Building a Better World One Student at a Time”
Sequoia Village is a K-12 tuition-free, Arizona charter school.  We offer highly qualified teachers and academic programs that exceed Arizona State Standards education.  Our school is small with only a few hundred students so our students get the individual attention they require.  See our School Report Card from the Arizona Department of Education.  We offer transportation and a free after school program including sports programs, music and tutoring.  We thank you for your interest in Sequoia Village.
Students in grades K-8 recieve classroom instruction by Highly Qualified Teachers. Small class sizes allow teachers to give the personalized academic attention your child needs. We offer a gifted program for students who are able to learn more quickly.
