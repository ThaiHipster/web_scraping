What is the Arizona state tax credit for public schools?
Arizona law provides a tax credit for contributions to public schools to support extracurricular activities or character education.
You can help Sequoia School students and possibly lower your tax bill by making a donation.
The state tax credit is available to all qualifying individual Arizona state taxpayers. You do not need to have a child enrolled in a school to take advantage of this state tax credit. It is always best to consult a tax adviser to see if you qualify for the dollar-for-dollar credit.
A tax credit is different from a deduction, because you may subtract the whole contribution from your Arizona state tax bill. An individual may contribute as much as $200, and a couple filing jointly may contribute as much as $400 to a public school and receive the money back in the form of a tax credit.
Here’s how it works:
If you qualify for this state tax credit, you may write a check or use your credit card to make a contribution before April 15th. When you file your Arizona state taxes, you then subtract the amount of your contribution from what you owe or add the amount to your refund.
Once your donation has been submitted, you will be able to request the program or area where your donation will be applied.
All of the donations go to support our schools and programs and are not used for general operation or employee salaries.
