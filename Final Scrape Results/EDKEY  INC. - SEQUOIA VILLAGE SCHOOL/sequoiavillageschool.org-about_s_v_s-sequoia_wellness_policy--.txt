WELLNESS POLICY
Download a Printable Copy of the Wellness Policy
The Sequoia Village School Health and Wellness Committee shall be comprised of the principal, health and wellness director, representative of the school food services authority, PE teacher, school Site Council, and community members. The Sequoia Village School Health and Wellness Committee recognizes that the Sequoia Schools’ communities can and should serve as a resource and model for wellness for staff, students, their families and the community, to demonstrate that:
1.	All school staff serves as role models for peers and students by improving their own health and reducing personal health risk factors;
2.	A healthy school environment encourages students to adopt healthy behaviors and improves the performance of staff members (i.e., reduces absenteeism and staff turnover, and improves morale, productivity and continuity of instruction);
3.	A comprehensive local health promotion program produces informed consumers who are motivated to reduce health risk factors, which are within their individual control, thereby reducing the rapidly escalating use and cost of medical services/insurance; and
4.	School-community coalitions create a climate for wellness that is mutually beneficial and can enhance taxpayer support of school programs and facilities.
The principal or his/her designee (shall be responsible for) organizing and implementing a comprehensive school-based health promotion program, including student and staff wellness activities, safety, environmental programs, comprehensive school health education curricula and health services.
The Committee supports establishing and maintaining the program as an integral component of the instructional, operational, and staff development activities of the district, based on the resources of the entire school staff, and the community at large.
• We have assessed and revised this policy at a minimum of once per month during the 2013 – 2014 academic year, in collaboration with Navajo County Health Dept.; updates and changes made to the policy are available upon request.
PHYSICAL EDUCATION
Physical Education (P.E.) K-12. Students in grades K-8, including students with disabilities, special health-care needs, and in alternative educational settings, will receive physical education for a one hour period, twice weekly, for at least one semester of the entire school year. Student involvement in other activities involving physical activity (e.g., interscholastic or intramural sports) will not be substituted for meeting the physical education requirement. Students will spend at least 50 percent of physical education class time participating in moderate to vigorous physical activity. 
Daily Recess.All elementary school students will have at least 20 minutes a day of supervised recess, preferably outdoors, during which schools should encourage moderate to vigorous physical activity verbally and through the provision of space and equipment.
Schools should discourage extended periods (i.e., periods of two or more hours) of inactivity. When activities, such as mandatory school-wide testing, make it necessary for students to remain indoors for long periods of time, schools should give students periodic breaks during which they are encouraged to stand and be moderately active.
Physical Activity Opportunities Before and After School. Students in grades 5 – 12 will be offered extracurricular physical activity programs, such as physical activity clubs or intramural programs. All high schools, and middle schools as appropriate, will offer interscholastic sports programs. Schools will offer a range of activities that meet the needs, interests, and abilities of all students, including boys, girls, students with disabilities, and students with special health-care needs.
After-school child care and enrichment programs will provide and encourage – verbally and through the provision of space, equipment, and activities – daily periods of moderate to vigorous physical activity for all participants. 
Physical Activity and Punishment. Teachers and other school and community personnel will not use physical activity (e.g., running laps, pushups) or withhold opportunities for physical activity (e.g., recess, physical education) as punishment.
Safe Routes to School. The school district will assess and, if necessary and to the extent possible, make needed improvements to make it safer and easier for students to walk and bike to school. When appropriate, the district will work together with local public works, public safety, and/or police departments in those efforts. The school district will explore the availability of federal “safe routes to school” funds, administered by the state department of transportation, to finance such improvements. 
Use of School Facilities Outside of School Hours. School spaces and facilities should be available to students, staff, and community members before, during, and after the school day, on weekends, and during school vacations. These spaces and facilities also should be available to community agencies and organizations offering physical activity and nutrition programs. School policies concerning safety will apply at all times.

TEACHING ABOUT ALCOHOL, DRUGS, AND TOBACCO
Alcohol, drug or tobacco abuse includes any physical or mental state resulting from the use of a drug for any purpose other than its medically prescribed use, and that this mental and/or physical effect precludes realization of the educational potential of the individual.  The objectives of the curriculum are rooted in the belief that prevention requires education and that the most important aspect of the policies and guidelines of the district should be the education of each individual student to the dangers of alcohol, drugs, and tobacco.  The Superintendent shall be responsible to establish and periodically review the district’s guidelines for staff members in conducting alcohol, drug, and tobacco education and dealing with abuse.
Objectives of Curriculum
1 .   To create an awareness of the total problem-prevention, education,                             treatment, rehabilitation, and law enforcement on the local, state, national, and         international levels.
2.	To inform the students of the effect on the body of narcotics, sedatives, hallucinogens, stimulants, alcohol, and tobacco.
3.	To relate the use of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco to physical, mental, social, and emotional practices.
4 .	To encourage the individual to adopt an appropriate attitude towards pain, stress, and discomfort.
5.	To develop the student’s ability to make intelligent choices based on facts and to develop the courage to stand by one’s own convictions.
6.	To understand the need for seeking professional advice in dealing with problems related to physical and mental health.
7.	To understand the personal, social, and economic problems causing the use of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco.
8.	To develop an interest in preventing illegal use of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco in the community.
FAMILY LIFE & SEX EDUCATION
The Board believes that the purpose of family life and sex education is to help students acquire factual knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values which will result in behavior that contributes to the well being of the individual, the family, and society.
Helping students attain a mature and responsible attitude toward human sexuality is a continuous task of every generation.  Parents have the prime responsibility to assist their children in developing moral values.  The schools should support and supplement parent’s efforts in these areas by offering student factual information and opportunities to discuss concerns, issues, and attitudes inherent in fancily life and sexual behavior, including traditional moral values.
In addition to the requirements listed below, the customary policies and regulations concerning the approval of new curriculum content, units, and materials shall apply to any course(s) dealing with family life and sex education offered by the district:
1 .	Instructional materials to be used in family life/sex education will be              available for inspection by the parent or guardian during school hours.	
2.	If, after review of materials used and a conference with the instructor and principal, a parent requests that his child not participate in a given aspect of the course, the parent must propose an alternate educational assignment for the student which must meet state requirements.
3.	Teachers who provide instruction in family life/sex education will have professional preparation in the subject area, either at the pre-service or in-service level.
4. We comply with anti-harassment and anti-discriminatory laws, guidelines,       and regulations in every aspect of education and culture at Sequoia Village School.
COMPLIANCE & MONITORING
Local Wellness Policies should be reviewed at least once a year by the Sequoia Schools Health and Wellness Committee. Compliance will be monitored as a part of the administrative review process on a 3 year cycle. If this policy is not adhered to non-compliant LEA’s could risk being placed in hold status, which will make them ineligible to receive reimbursement through the NSL and Breakfast programs as well as ineligible to receive USDA commodities. Effective July 1, 2014, K-12, only certain foods can be sold on campuses that participate in the NSLP. These rules do not apply to foods brought from home as bagged lunches or for birthday parties, off campus fundraisers, athletic events and school plays or foods sold during non-school hours.

SEQUOIA SCHOOLS COORDINATED SCHOOL HEALTH PLAN
The mission of Sequoia Schools – Sequoia Village School Health and Wellness Committee is to “work to promote education and empowerment initiatives devised to impact students, staff, parents, and community partners through physical, social, spiritual (non-denominational), emotional, intellectual, and environmental wellness.”Coordinated School Health (CSH) was developed by the Center for Disease Control as a strategy for improving health and increasing integrated learning in our schools and nation. Health is a key component to success in school, relationships and work. The CDC has 8 interrelated components for schools to integrate, educate and implement around. The 8 areas are listed below along with what Sequoia is doing to help implement and educate our students, staff, parents and community in the resources available to them. Please feel free to advocate for additional resources, information, implementation tools, and ways to help make this program a success for everyone. The Health and Wellness Committee meets monthly and reports during the Site Council Meetings; anyone in the school and community is welcome!
1.	Health Education – Sequoia Village School has a comprehensive health education program. Sequoia Village School has teamed up with three outside entities:  Arizona Youth Partnership offers their Healthy Relationship classes to grades 7 -12. The Navajo County Health Dept. offers the T.O.P. (Teen Outreach Program) to our junior high students where they learn about healthy relationships while mentoring and taking part in activities outside school hours, such as fund-raisers, as well as inviting community members into the school for a school-wide and public Health Fair. Students in K-6 receive health, nutrition, and healthy lifestyles classes from Navajo County Health Department.
2.	Physical Education – The Physical Education Program has moved into the brand new electives program within Sequoia Village School. Students may now also sign up for dance and Zumba classes from our certified staff. If your family would like to have Community Open Gym Events open to parents and students, please let the H&W Committee know. Also please see 
www.letsmove.gov
 for more information on leading a healthy and active lifestyle.
3.	Health Services – Our staff are Basic First Aid and CPR certified. Basic health services are also available through the front office where student medications and regular first aid is available.  We frequently partner with Linden Fire Department, our neighbors, to educate students, staff, and parents about fire awareness and safety.
4.	Mental Health and Social Services – Sequoia Village School makes Mental and Social Health services available through referrals to appropriate agencies. The McKinney-Vento Act is a federal homeless act that is facilitated by campus liaisons located at each campus of the Sequoia family and has many resources available for families needing services. The liaisons at each school have access to the room. Please see your individual administrators for who that contact person is.
5.	Nutrition services – The school lunch program is designed around Federal Nutritional Standards. We plan on making more nutritional knowledge available to students throughout the school with posters and handouts. We follow the NSLP through the meals prepared on campus. The National Food Pyramid has been updated and is available at 
www.myplate.gov
.
6.	Healthy and Safe Environments – Every student has the right to a safe learning environment. All schools are drug free, tobacco free and bullying free zones. All staff and students recently went through identifying bullying and two key points for parents to be aware of and utilize is TATTLING Versus NOTIFYING (or TELLING). The GOAL of Tattling is to get someone in trouble versus the GOAL of Notifying/Telling is to keep yourself and others safe. Anyone who has knowledge of inappropriate threats or anything that creates a hostile environment that makes learning emotionally challenging is responsible for either helping to stop the inappropriate language and behaviors or responsible for reporting it. The lack or negligence of reporting dangerous activities can constitute being an accessory to the activity and may result in appropriate consequences/punishment. Sequoia Village School frequently works with Navajo County Sheriff’s Office to create a safer campus. There are a minimum of four Sheriff’s Office involved lock-down drills each year. There is also a full staff orientation to the Sequoia Village School Emergency response plan, which is revised a minimum of once per year. During the staff orientation, there is often an Active Shooter Module or class presented.
7.	Family and Community Involvement – All family and community members may be involved in the Health and Wellness Programs. Due to family and community involvement our annual Health and Wellness Fair as well as International Walk/Bike to school days have been a large success. Community and business donations are tax deductible and may help support educational and fitness activities that benefit everyone. Our local wellness policy will be posted on the sequoiavillageschool.org website, in addition to links to the Navajo County Health Dept. Families and community members are invited to provide feedback.
8.	Staff Wellness – Staff members are asked to model good health and wellness choices for their community. The H&W Committee is looking into different models, tools and programs that can assist staff in their goals to be healthy and fit in all the core areas of health listed in our mission statement. We are currently in the process of developing a new Employee Wellness Program through Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona. This program will require employees to complete a Health Risk Assessment as well as any one of the following: biometric screening/physical exam, healthy living programs, wellness challenges and online monthly seminars.
