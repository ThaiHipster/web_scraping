Curriculum Overview K-8th – Essential Questions and Enduring Understandings
TISA integrates the arts–visual arts, dance, music and theater – into the general learning process and they are interwoven throughout the lessons using a thematic, interdisciplinary, project-based approach to instruction. TISA also educates with a vision of the “TISA Graduate” in mind, and the curriculum work backwards from 8 to K using two Essential Questions – like the side-rails of a ladder – to guide a student up and through the complete experience. These Essential Questions are: “Who am I?” and “What is Design?” Students re-visit these questions in a fashion appropriate for their class and the content of the lessons.  Below is an outline of the curriculum by grade level.
