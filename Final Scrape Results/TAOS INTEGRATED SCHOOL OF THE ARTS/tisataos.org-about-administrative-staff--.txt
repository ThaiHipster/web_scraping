about Administrative Staff
Nicole Abeyta
Asst. Business Manager/ Compliance Officer
Nicole was born and raised in Taos on a farm South of town. Nicole grew up very close to her family with one younger sister. Nicole has always been very active in the community and giving back to others. Nicole has traveled to both New York and London to perform with her dance groups in her adolescence years. Nicole was seeking a degree in sonography but quickly found that after getting certified in Phlebotomy that the medical field was maybe not for her. She has then turned to helping others through accounting and finance. Nicole has worked with adults with disabilities for over 5 years, not always an easy job, but very rewarding. Nicole has relocated to her hometown Taos, where she raises her two boys. Nicole loves working with children and is very excited to be a part of the TISA team. Nicole would one day like to see her two boys be a part of the TISA community as well.

Ashley Romero
Administrative Assistant
Ashley is enjoying her first year as a part of the TISA Community. She enjoys working with children and helping them reach for their dreams through their education. Ashley believes an education should empower a child and help him or her make a positive contribution to our world.  Ashley was born and raised in Taos, New Mexico and has spent the past four years in Albuquerque, New Mexico to pursue Education from the University of New Mexico and is happy to be home again! She enjoys being outdoors.  During the summer she spends her free-time gardening, hiking, and camping.  In the winter, she loves to ski, and snowmobile.  I look forward to getting to know all of you this school year and for the years to come!
