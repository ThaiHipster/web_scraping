Gary City Truancy Court Program 
Indiana law states that if a parent does not ensure that his or her child goes to school, the parent can be charged with failure to educate which is a Class B misdemeanor punishable by a maximum penalty of 180 days in jail and up to a $1,000 fine. 
According to Mayor Freeman-Wilson, if a student has four unexcused absences, a letter will be sent to the parent explaining that the child is in danger of becoming truant. After nine unexcused absences, a formal charge will be filed with the Lake County Prosecutor’s office. Parents will be required to attend court sessions with their children.
