Uniform Policy
South Pointe High School is a uniform school. We have discovered that  uniforms help curb violence in school, including gang representation.  We also believe that uniforms reduce peer pressure and encourage better  discipline on campus. In order to maintain an orderly and efficient  campus, the uniforms must be worn properly at all times. This is  non-negotiable. Students who are not in uniform will be sent home.
 To our returning South Pointe students and families, we thank you   for your unwavering support.  If you are a prospective South Pointe  parent, we assure you that we know uniforms are a big commitment,  but we are confident you will see the  benefits to your students, and to  the community at large. Uniforms are just one more step in the  direction of making South Pointe the best school choice in South  Phoenix. If you have any questions or concerns about the uniform policy,  please call the school, or make an appointment through the front  office.
