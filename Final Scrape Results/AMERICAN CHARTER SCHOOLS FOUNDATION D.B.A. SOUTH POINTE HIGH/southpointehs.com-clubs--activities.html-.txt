Clubs & Activities
​
​South Pointe High School offers many extracurricular clubs and activities for students to develop and expand their interests, talents, service to the school and community, and to participate actively in school life. These range from honor societies to South Pointe Youth Council and many service and special interest clubs and organizations.
Students can get a preview of these extracurricular activities offerings at the school’s Activity Fair in the fall. They may also form their own club or activity, subject to school leader approval.  All clubs and activities must be sponsored and supervised by a school staff person.
To be eligible for any extracurricular activity, a student must have obtained a 2.0 grade point average (GPA) for the previous nine-week grading period. The first nine-week eligibility period for the school year is determined by the fourth-quarter grades from the previous school year. Serious behavior infractions, failing a class, or excessive unexcused absences may be sufficient reason for declaring a student ineligible to participate at any time.
