At South Pointe High, we not only strive for academic excellence, we foster growth through extracurricular activities.  In participating in sports, students learn fundamental life lessons in teamwork, friendly competition, and self-discipline.  Because of our firm No-Pass, No-Play Policy, students who participate in high school sports generally have higher grades than those who choose not to participate. 
​We have full membership in the Charter Athletic Association. This places our school in a position to compete in playoffs and state championships. South Pointe is building a tradition of focusing on student athletes.
​
To be eligible for any athletic or extracurricular activity, a student must have obtained a 2.0 grade point average (GPA) for the previous nine-week grading period. The first nine-week eligibility period for the school year is determined by the fourth-quarter grades from the previous school year. Serious behavior infractions, failing a class during the athletic season, or excessive unexcused absences may be sufficient reason for declaring a student ineligible to participate at any time.
