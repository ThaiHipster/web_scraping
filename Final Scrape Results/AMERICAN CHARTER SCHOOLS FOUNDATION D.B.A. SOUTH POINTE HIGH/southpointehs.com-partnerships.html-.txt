Arizona Tax Credit
All Arizona taxpayers are eligible to make contributions to public schools to support extracurricular activities. You can help students while lowering your tax bill by making your tax-deductible contribution today! 
It's a win-win situation for taxpayers and students!
We strive to provide a well-rounded educational experience for all students by going beyond the traditional classroom. Extracurricular activities help youth develop qualities such as leadership, team play, and cooperation, as well as provide safe, supervised activities after school hours. Some of the activities you will be supporting include performing arts, field trips, outdoor education, gardening, sports and tutoring, just to name a few.
Who is eligible?
This tax credit is available to all Arizona taxpayers regardless of whether or not they have children in school. An individual may contribute as much as $200; a couple filing jointly may contribute up to $400.Taxpayers may also deduct the amount on federal returns as a charitable contribution. 
How to contribute:
You can contribute safely online right now!
Donations must be received by December 31, 2012 to be eligible for the tax credit this year.
Thank you for supporting our students!
