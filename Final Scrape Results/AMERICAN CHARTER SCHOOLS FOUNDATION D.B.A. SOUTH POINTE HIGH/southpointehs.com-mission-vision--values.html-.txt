Arizona State Board for Charter Schools Mission Statement: 
The mission of South Pointe High School is to help all students develop basic skills, understanding and attitudes necessary to become productive citizens. We accomplish this through an integrated approach using curriculum aligned to the Arizona State Standards and relevant instruction. The School serves young people for whom traditional schools have not been effective and predictably will not be in the future. As such, essentially all students meet one or more of the Arizona's definition of an alternative school. That is, they have behavioral issues, have dropped out or are likely to drop out, are pregnant or parenting, have a history of academic failure or have been adjudicated. It is the specific mission of the school to serve such students.
Managed by The Leona Group
