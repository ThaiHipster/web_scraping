Students at South Pointe enjoy the enhanced flexibility offered by our block scheduling system. The block schedule consists of four nine-week blocks per school year. During each block, students take and complete three or more courses. Each course meets Monday through Thursday for 105 minutes and for one hour each Friday.
The block schedule enables students to earn six or more credits per year, depending upon which option is chosen. Friday afternoons are dedicated to student services, such as tutoring, testing, conferences, field trips and career-related activities. Block scheduling offers students the motivational advantage of being able to earn a positive reward in a shorter amount of time. It also allows the student who has fallen behind to catch up and graduate on time. Freshmen are required to enroll in four classes. All other students are required to enroll in a minimum of three classes per block.
We are a closed campus, therefore, all students must remain at school during the lunch break. Lunch is served on campus.
