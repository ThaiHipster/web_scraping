English Language Acquisition Services (ELAS)
Arizona law requires that students with a home language other then English be assessed for proficiency in oral language, reading comprehension and written communication.  Based on the results of the assessment, students may be placed in the English Language Learners program designed to aid them in acquiring English.
South Pointe High School’s English Language Learners program (ELL) serves students who need assistance learning English. ELL teachers use instructional methods, special projects and computer programs to work individually with students in the areas of listening, speaking, reading and writing English.
If you have any questions regarding ELAS, please contact Danielle Borja, ELA Coordinator at 602-243-0600 or by
