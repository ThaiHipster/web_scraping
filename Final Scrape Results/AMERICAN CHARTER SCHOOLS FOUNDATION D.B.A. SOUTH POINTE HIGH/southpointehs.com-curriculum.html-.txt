Curriculum
South Pointe High School offers curriculum that is directly aligned to Arizona’s College and Career Ready Standards. Each core academic area (English, Math, Science, and Social Studies) has a Scope and Sequence for each course that is offered to students.  All of our teachers and staff participate in Professional Development to assure that everyone has access to new strategies and best practices for the classroom in order to prepare our students for the AZMerit and success beyond high school.  Students take the AZMerit exam for each end of year course they are enrolled in throughout the year. Alignment of standards for Pre and Post testing, required by the state, is also mandatory for all students in all core areas.
Student, parents, and an academic advisor will decide the course of study (Standard, Scholastic, or Honors) that the student will follow and use the 
Credit Analysis
 to keep track of credits earned.
