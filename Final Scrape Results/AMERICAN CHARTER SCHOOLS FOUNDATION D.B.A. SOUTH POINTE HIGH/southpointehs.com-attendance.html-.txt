Attendance
South Pointe High School operates on a quarter schedule system. During the regular school year we offer four quarters as reflected on the school calendar. During each quarter, the student takes and completes four courses. At the end of the quarter the earned credit is then applied to the transcript. This system offers the student the motivational advantage of being able to earn a positive reward in a shorter amount of time. It also allows the student who has fallen behind to catch up and graduate before the end of the school year.
Attendance and academic success are highly correlated; therefore South Pointe High School promotes good attendance practices. Students are expected to attend school every day in order to receive course credit. Missed time must be made up.
Absences 
Excused absences: For an absence to be excused, a parent/guardian needs to call the day of absence, then send a written note with the child when they return. The student also needs to make up the time. An alternative is to have the attending physician fax a notification to the school office. Students must submit absence notes within 5 school days of absence. Parents are expected to contact the office by phone each day the child is absent. For absences that extend beyond three days or for missing exams and standardized tests (AIMS, TerraNova, etc.,) a meeting with the principal will be required.
4 unexcused absences results in disciplinary action; this may jeopardize the child's grade and status for re-enrollment for the following school year.
5 unexcused absences may result in loss of credit. 
10 unexcused absences results in withdrawal. If a student accrues ten consecutive unexcused absences in all classes, he or she will be withdrawn from the school. If a student is withdrawn from the school he or she may re-enroll, if space permits, and continue his or her education. Additionally, if a student misses the first 3 days of a new block he/she is dropped from his/her scheduled classes but can be re-scheduled to different classes/class schedule upon reenrollment, if space permits.
