About Our School
Hillcrest Primary School is a LEED Gold certified building serving the Shawano community.  It opened its doors in the 2010-2011 school year.  It is an Achievement Gap Reduction (AGR) School.  Because of this, our class sizes are in the 18-20 students range in Kindergarten through 2nd grade.  Hillcrest’s colors are red and black with a hawk for a mascot.
At Hillcrest, our staff is dedicated to providing a high quality education.  Our motto is “Committed to Excellence”.  This is what we and the school district refer to as The Hawk Way!  We currently employ approximately 100 professional and support staff who help meet the educational needs of our students.  We differentiate instruction to maximize learning.  Our staff monitors student progress using the STAR computerized assessment (measures math and literacy), Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark  Reading Assessment System, Standardized Writing Assessment, Spelling Inventory, other diagnostic literacy assessments, the Number development Assessment (NDA) and the Fact Fluency Inventory (FFI).  Teachers use formative assessments on a day to day basis to monitor student learning and plan future instruction.
If students need additional support, we offer Title I Reading and Math, Title VII assistance, English Language Learners support, Alternative Education Options, as well as, Special Needs Education.
We use the following programs; FOSS Science, MyMath, Nystrom - Hands on Social Studies Program, the Lucy Calkins – Units of Study for Reading and Writing and Fountas and Pinnell Phonics to meet district and state benchmarks and standards.
Here at Hillcrest Primary School, we believe that NOTHING is more important than a great education for our area children.   With this in mind, the most important element in a child’s education is the staff who work with our students.  Our teaching staff is highly trained in the latest best practice teaching and technology skills, but more importantly, they care about our students.  As the principal of Hillcrest Primary School, I understand the importance of providing not only quality teachers but also cutting edge technology to better assist your children as they move forward in this complex world we live in. Our students have access to Smart Boards, ELMO – document cameras, voice amplification systems, projectors, IPads, tablets, laptops and desk top computers. 
We use Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) for our school wide discipline program.  With PBIS, we can monitor student behaviors and use the data to make specific improvements to our school wide discipline plan or an individual discipline plan as needed.  We teach, encourage and expect positive behavior choices from our students.  As a support to PBIS, we also incorporate Conscious Discipline and Responsive Classroom techniques and strategies on our menu of options in our discipline plan.
Our school encourages our students and staff to have a growth mindset.  A growth mindset tells us that if we try hard, stretch our abilities, learn from mistakes, and persevere that your brain will make connections and grow.  If you are not able to do something, then we say we are not able to do it YET and we keep trying!  Watch for signs around our school with the word YET on it.
Teaching our area children is a process, not a timeline, and we want the children who attend Hillcrest Primary School to develop socially, emotionally, physically and academically to be ready for the next challenges life gives them.
