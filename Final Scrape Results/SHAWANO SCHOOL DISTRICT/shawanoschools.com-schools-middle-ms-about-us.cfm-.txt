About Shawano Community Middle School
Shawano Community Middle School (SCMS) has students from grades 6 through 8. All students are encouraged to behave in The Hawk Way: Be respectful, Be responsible, Be Safe. We have numerous extracurricular activities to fit each student’s interests including Student Council, Yearbook, sports, Destination Imagination, Forensics, and Spelling Bee, to name a few.  
Technology is highly visible at SCMS, with ELMO document projectors in 100% of classrooms, SMART Boards in 95% of our classrooms, and full Chrome Carts in 27 out of 31 classrooms.  We also house a full computer lab and another full Chrome Cart in our school library.  Students are able to bring their own devices to school and use the building wireless system to log onto the internet.  There is also opportunity to use technology during after school Homework Club and Computer Lab times to complete homework or other projects.
Constructed in 1954, the building was first Shawano High School and then became the middle school when the new high school was completed in 1997. Formerly called Franklin Middle School, SCMS had students in grades 5-8 until 5th grade was moved back to Olga Brener Intermediate School.
