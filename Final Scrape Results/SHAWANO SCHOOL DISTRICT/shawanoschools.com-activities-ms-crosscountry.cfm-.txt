Other Notes:
Reminder to parents to make sure your athlete is prepared for practices and meets. As the weather gets colder make sure they have proper warm-ups and possibly rain gear. We don't know what the weather will be and we will run in all conditions!!
Remind them to stretch at home after practice and in the morning. We need to make sure we take care of their bodies.
Also make sure they bring along fluids and snacks. I am not positive that all meets will have concessions.
