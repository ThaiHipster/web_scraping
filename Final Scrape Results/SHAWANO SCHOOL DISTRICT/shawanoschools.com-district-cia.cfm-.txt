Curriculum, Instruction & Assessment (CIA)
My name is Kelley Strike and I am the Director of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessment (CIA) for the Shawano School District.  I work in collaboration with principals and teachers to provide high-quality learning opportunities for all students in the Shawano School District.  My primary responsibilities include:
• Guide, 
coordinate,
 and plan implementation and evaluation of curriculum in the district.
• Assist teachers in designing instruction and supporting instruction that meets the needs of all learners.
• Coordinate state and local assessments.
• Ensure that staff monitor and respond to regular assessment data that allows us to be responsive to student needs.
• Provide quality staff development so
that teachers
 are equipped with research-based practices.
I often use the analogy of a GPS system to describe the curriculum writing and adoption process.  Much like an address in a GPS, standards define the end goal.  And as a GPS system can suggest multiple routes to get to the destination, a district chooses the route to take to ensure students reach the end goal.  These decisions include the adoption of a key resource, grouping standards into units, the progression of delivering units, etc.  And just as drivers have choices in how they travel the route to their final destination; our teachers make choices as they follow the district curriculum.  They determine how fast to 
drive,
 when to make a stop or even if they need to turn back because they forgot something.  The district and teachers have ownership in the curriculum process.
There are many changes and initiatives facing public education today in regard to curriculum, instruction and assessment.  State and federal mandates, knowledge gained from educational research and the adoption of new standards have shifted our practices.  We are committed to providing a quality education to all Shawano School District students so they have the capacity to succeed in an ever-changing world.
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions in regard to curriculum, instruction and assessment.
Project Inspire 
- During the summer, I coordinate courses for educators' professional development.  The weeklong event is called 
Project Inspire
 (Click on 
link
 for more specific information).  The courses are open to local area educators and can be taken for 3 Viterbo graduate credits.
