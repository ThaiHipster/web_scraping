Shawano Hawks Forensics
Thanks for visiting our Shawano Hawks Forensics page!
Forensics is a competitive speech event. Students can pick from a variety of categories to enter and focus on informative speaking, current events, persuasive speaking, or dramatic interpretations of literature. There are events for individuals as well as groups. Some of the popular categories include: Play Acting, Moments in History, Storytelling, Poetry, Prose and Group Interpretive Reading. The high school-level team travels to festivals; including conference, sub-district, district and state. 
Students can receive awards in their category. Participants are asked to meet with a coach weekly to practice their delivery and attend all scheduled events. Forensics provides students with valuable life skills, improved public speaking, acting opportunities, team building, and lots of fun!
If you're interested in being part of the 2017 team and have a potential category selected, your next task will be to find several pieces that will work for your category. If you're new to forensics, any of the coaches listed below can help guide you on selecting items that will work for your category. At the high school, we also have an information board located in the English Pod - watch for meeting announcements and updates.
The high school team will have a general meeting in November to kick off the season, with four "meets" scheduled February through April. High school coaches include Ms. Martin, Mrs. Kann, Mr. Konen, and Mr. Falk. 
Our calendar is shown below - more details will be added as they become available.
