Thank You Voters
Proposition 51 passed in November 2016 which provides the opportunity for Shiloh School to continue realizing its goals of increasing the size of its facility, eliminating combination classrooms, hiring new teachers and increasing opportunities for students.  Parents, please provide comments and feedback on your annual survey this April 2017 to help guide district administration in realizing your visions and dreams of what Shiloh School can provide for you and your children.  Thank you!
