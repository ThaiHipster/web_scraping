The 
Creed
Building a positive school culture is very important at Urban Prep as it helps promote positive self-esteem and high achievement.
One way we foster a positive school culture is by holding our students accountable to live by the Urban Prep Creed which they recite each morning in Community. The Creed was developed by Team UP prior to the opening of the school and it has been embraced by our entire community.
