The Englewood Community has a complex and storied history.  As a stop on the Underground Railroad, Englewood was an early beacon of hope for African-Americans escaping slavery.  Today, Englewood is on track to shine again with opportunity and our first campus, Urban Prep Charter Academy for Young Men -- Englewood Campus, seeks to be of the lights in this rekindling.
