History
Urban Prep Academies is a nonprofit organization founded in 2002 by education entrepreneur Tim King and a group of African-American education, business and civic leaders. Urban Prep's mission is to provide a comprehensive, high-quality college preparatory education to young men that results in graduates succeeding in college.
Our first school -
 Urban Prep Charter Academy for Young Men, Englewood Campus
 - opened in 2006. Urban Prep's Englewood Campus is the country's first all-boys public charter high school. In 2009, we opened our second school: 
Urban Prep Academy for Young Men, West Campus
. Our third school, 
Urban Prep Academy for Young Men, Bronzeville Campus
, opened its doors in the fall of 2010. Urban Prep's schools are the only all-boys public schools in the state of Illinois.
The Urban Prep motto is We Believe. Our motto is a constant reminder that Urban Prep students will not fall into the trap of negative stereotypes and low expectations. Instead, Urban Prep students believe in their potential and believe in their ability to exceed that potential. The Urban Prep family (teachers, administrators, staff, board of directors, community members and donors) also believe in these young men, and in our important and long lasting role in their lives. At Urban Prep, We Believe.
