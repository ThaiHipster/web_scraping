GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., April 15, 2015
—A new after schoolprogram at River City Scholars Charter Academy is promoting science,technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills to female students. Theprogram is called GEMS which stands for Girls Exploring Math and Science. 
The national GEMS programstarted in 1994 by a teacher and parent of two daughters who wanted to supportSTEM skills for girls in elementary and middle school. 
“We really wanted tobring this club to River City Scholars to give girls a chance to explore STEMfields in a fun way,” said teacher Amanda Barnett. “Girls are not representedwell in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in oursociety. While women make up about half of the work force, they make up lessthan 25 percent of the STEM workforce.”
The students dohands-on STEM activities that teach them how to use the scientific andengineering process, to problem solve, work cooperatively with one another, andpractice important writing skills.
Recently the GEMSexplored the chemical properties of Oobleck, a fluid that has properties of aliquid and a solid. They learned how temperature and pressure both affect thethickness of substances in different ways.
Fifth-grade studentCarla Palmer said learning about Oobleck was her favorite experiment and shewould like to try to build her own shoes with it.  
Her classmate KaytiaGibbs said, “I really like doing research and wearing goggles. It makes me feellike a real scientist!”
Barnett said anotherpopular experiment this year was when the students made their ownchromatography T-shirts. “They created their own tie dye by learning how toseparate mixtures and watch the colors spread across the fabric,” Barnett said.
Other experimentsinclude designing and creating a package to safely mail a Pringle withoutbreaking it, learning computer coding, building their own flashlights, andlaunching pop bottle rockets.
“I like to build andmake stuff, and I thought the things we would do in the club sounded fun,” saidNadia Sheler.
River City ScholarsCharter Academy is a free public charter school serving students inkindergarten through seventh grade. It will add eighth grade next year toestablish a K-8 school.
