Our Focus
Preparing your child for a lifetime of success
See what happens when hard work, personal responsibility, and a nurturing school community combine to create one exceptional experience. Founded on academic excellence, moral focus, parental partnership, and student responsibility, River City Scholars is a school like no other—one that can lead your child to a lifetime of success. 
Academic excellence
Academic excellence is teachers working closely with students to shape their critical thinking skills. It’s a strong emphasis on the fundamentals, such as math, reading, science, and social studies. And it’s teachers setting academic growth goals, developing learning plans, tracking individual progress, and adjusting instruction when necessary. 
Moral focus
Virtues such as respect, integrity, and compassion are central to our school community. In fact, our entire school focuses on a new virtue each month. This helps students learn the importance of making good choices in life.
Parental partnership							     
When parents, teachers, and students work together, they form a powerful triangle of success. For this reason, parents are always welcome to stop by our school and join us in the classroom. Our teachers also make a point of being available to discuss your child’s progress or address concerns. For us, parental partnership is key to a strong school community.  
Student responsibility						          
Students must learn to be accountable for their actions. This means completing assignments, participating in classroom discussions, behaving respectfully, and following our rules and procedures. Our “no excuses” approach helps kids learn at a young age that strong character is developed through personal responsibility.
Safety and security
We provide a safe and emotionally secure learning environment. This means maintaining strict safety measures, such as keeping exterior doors locked and requiring all visitors to check in when they arrive. At the same time, our teachers establish strong relationships with students. This includes greeting them as they arrive each day. Students also draft a social contract that reinforces their commitment to their school, their teachers, and each other. 
​
​
Our parents are invited to actively participate in their child's education and to regularly communicate with teachers and principals.
