Why River City Scholars?
                Founded on academic excellence, moral focus, parental partnership, and student responsibility, River City Scholars is a school like no other –one that can lead to a lifetime of success. We provide a safe learning environment and our exceptional teachers individualize instruction based on your child’s needs. In addition, we focus on real-world skills and how to be a good person. Our students also draft a social contract that reinforces their commitment to their school, their teacher, and each other.            
                "Excellent school! I hope to send all my kids here in the future. Thank you River City Scholars for all the great effort and keep up the excellence in education you have achieved."
