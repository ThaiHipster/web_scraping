Dress Code		
Dress Code
To reduce distraction and competition the school has a dress code.   A simple, flexible, cost-effective dress code promotes student learning and increases academic instruction time.  Interpretation of the Dress Code is at the discretion of the principal and staff.  Their decision is final. 
Personal Hygiene
The personal grooming of students should be in accord with the standards set by the uniform dress code.  Students should be clean and neat when at school.   
General Expectations
Students are required to abide by the following:     
All shirts must be a short- or long-sleeved polo. A bright green polo purchased only through Image Builders is encouraged.  Please contact Image Builder’s toll-free customer service hotline at 
(855) 654-6243
 or go to the school’s website for more information.  Alternatively, a white polo may be purchased at a manufacturer of your choice.    
Slacks or dress pants must be navy blue or black for grades K-5.     Grades 6-8  may wear slacks or dress pants that are navy blue, khaki, or black. 
Middle school students may also wear a short- or long-sleeved white dress shirt with a tie. A tie purchased only through Image Builders is encouraged. 
Conservative shoes, including loafer style, dress shoes, tennis shoes, or closed toed sandals, must be worn.  Shoe colors may vary.   Shoes must be worn appropriately (i.e., laced and/or strapped all the way for safety purposes).  Athletic shoes with non-marking soles are to be worn for P.E. class.

A belt must be worn with all pants and shorts when appropriate .  Belt loops may not be removed from pants or shorts to avoid wearing belts.  Due to developmental needs, young fives and kindergarten are not required to wear a belt.
