Volunteer
​We welcome and encourage parental participation  
​A strong component of our school is the involvement of our wonderful parents. We hope to see you often at the school. Parents are always welcome in our building. There are several areas parents can be an integral part of the school, some of which include: classroom help, school committees, lunch supervision, field trips, and many others.  
Volunteers are appreciated for the contribution of their time and talents to the students, staff and school. The purpose of this guideline is to provide guidance on the background check requirements for school volunteers in compliance with state law and school policy to promote school safety.
A volunteer is defined as an individual who performs a service to the school and/or the school’s students without compensation. A volunteer need not be a parent of a student enrolled in the school. 
Volunteer Opportunities
Volunteer opportunities include but are not limited to: field trip chaperones (day and overnight); mentoring; tutoring; assisting in a classroom, library, office, or on a playground or other designated duties. Participation in school advisory committees, parent organizations, or similar activities that involve the monetary responsibility or activities that involve students apply to this guideline.
The school reserves the right to deny or discontinue volunteer opportunities to an individual at the principal’s discretion.
Learn more about volunteering, including responsibilities and qualifications here. 
​
Volunteering is a great way to get to know your child's teacher and to see your child interact with other students.
