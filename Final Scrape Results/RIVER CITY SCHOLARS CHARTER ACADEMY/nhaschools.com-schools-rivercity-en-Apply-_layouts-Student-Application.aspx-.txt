Questions & Answers
How will I know if my child is accepted into the school?
If your child is accepted, the school will send out an Acceptance Package. The Acceptance Package is your first critical step to completing the enrollment process at our school as it contains further information about necessary paperwork. 
What happens if there are no seats available?
In some situations, the grade to which your child is applying may have a waiting list. If your child is placed on the waiting list, do not be discouraged. Waiting list movement is very common, especially during the summer months. Openings can occur at any time, even after the school year begins. You will be notified by mail, email or phone when a seat becomes available.
How does the lottery work?
The lottery is a random selection process that is performed if more applications are received during open enrollment than there are seats available. All applicants will be notified of the lottery date for the appropriate school year. Lottery results will be communicated through the mail.
How does sibling preference work?
In order to accommodate parents who have more than one child eligible for enrollment, siblings of students accepted during the lottery (excluding North Carolina and Ohio schools) or currently enrolled students are given preference over students who don’t have accepted or enrolled siblings. Siblings will be offered the first available seat in their respective grade or placed on a waiting list with sibling preference. Sibling preference is defined as children who have at least one common parent/legal guardian AND are living in the same household at least 50% of the time.
Are other preferences offered at the school?
Preferences may vary depending on the school’s charter agreement. See Terms and Conditions for preferences offered.
How do I schedule a school tour?
To schedule a school tour, please visit our Contact Us page and fill out the form. Once submitted, the school will contact you to schedule an appropriate time.

Each application is valid for one school year only. Students once enrolled do not need to apply for future years.
Students may apply to only one grade per academic year.
The school will not accept an application for any student who is not a resident of this state.
Re-Enrollment Information
Once a student is enrolled and remains enrolled, he/she will remain eligible to be re-enrolled at the school for successive years without having to re-enter the random selection process.  However, the student will be asked to complete a Re-Enrollment Form by the end of the Open Enrollment Period showing intent to re-enroll for the subsequent school year.  By providing the school with a “Yes” or “Undecided” decision, a seat will be held for the student.  By providing the school with a “No” decision, a seat will NOT be held for the student.  If a “No” has been submitted to the school and the student later wishes to re-enroll, a new application must be completed.  In this event, no preference will be given to a student who wishes to reapply.
