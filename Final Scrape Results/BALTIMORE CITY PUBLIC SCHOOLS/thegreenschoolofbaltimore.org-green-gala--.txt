The Green School of Baltimore’s Fundraising Committee is hosting the 10th Annual Green Gala and Silent Auction, a social event with a silent auction to benefit and support the school’s current and future goals of excellence in education. During this financially challenging time for all Baltimore City Public Schools, The Green School uses proceeds raised from the Green Gala each year to fill the gap in its annual budget, while improving the school campus and enriching our students’ experiences in arts, culture, and the environment  while  partnering  with  community  stakeholders, creatives, and organizations.
The Gala is not only the school’s largest fundraiser and an evening of fun and merriment, it also a great opportunity to meet administrators, teachers, staff, alumni and parents.  
This year's theme is YOU JEST! Celebrating April Fool's Day and will be held at 
AREA 405
 Dress as your favorite Comic Relief, Jester, Joker, April Fool or come as you are. All are welcome!
Special Prizes for favorite costumes!

This annual benefit supports The Green School of Baltimore - a Baltimore City Public Charter School. 
By attending this event, you are supporting The Green School and its Kindergarten through Fifth Grade students. GSB uses the funds raised by this event to make the school's campus "GREEN" and more environmentally conscious, increase our students' experiences with Baltimore artists of all types, maintain our gardens, and support our children's educational opportunities.
With increasing costs and decreased funding of public education, the funds received are more vital than ever to the success of every child who attends this Kindergarten through 5th grade school.
The Ticket price is just $36 per person and includes refreshments - a bar with beer, wine, and non-alcoholic beverages and amazing hors d'oeuvres from locally sourced vendors. The $36 ticket equates to about one dollar for every seven days our children attend GSB.
The night is filled with various live entertainment including a DJ, raffles and our famous silent auction. 
By purchasing a ticket online, you are automatically registered for the silent auction. Our silent auction will be available online this year.  If you cannot attend and still would like to participate, you can register here:
