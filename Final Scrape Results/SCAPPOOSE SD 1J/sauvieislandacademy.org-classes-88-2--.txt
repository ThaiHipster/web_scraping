Confidentiality and Conformed Consent
A school counselor strives to build trust with the students they work with. In order to build trust they must maintain confidentiality. It is essential that students and parents are informed of the parameters of confidentiality.
Additionally, it is their ethical and legal duty to disclose to students in an appropriate and culturally sensitive way the potential risks, benefits and alternatives to proposed counseling.
What your child says during counseling is confidential, however, there are some exceptions that you should be aware of. A counsleor is required by law, and by professional ethics, to break confidentiality if:
They believe your child presents a threat to themselves or others.
They become aware of, or suspect, child or adult abuse or neglect.
When ordered by the court.
If you have any questions about informed consent and/or confidentiality please do not hesitate to contact Ms. Gwendolyn.
