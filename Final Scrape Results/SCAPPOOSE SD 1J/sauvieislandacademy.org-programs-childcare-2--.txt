After School Care Program for Grades K-8
We would like to invite you to take advantage of our After School Care Program available to students attending Sauvie Island Academy during the school year.  There are various options to accommodate any schedule with options ranging from 2-5 days a week.  Space is limited and will be on a first come first serve basis.  If you are interested in registering your student, please submit a 
After Care form
 to the school.
A non-refundable deposit of $50 per student (applied to the first month’s payment) is due at the time of registration in order to secure your student’s spot in the afterschool care program. Tuition is due on the 1st of every month. If your circumstances change during the school year, please provide Sauvie Island Academy 14 days notice prior to withdrawing your student from the program. Care is only for students enrolled at Sauvie Island Academy.
Drop in care will only be accommodated when space is available. Priority will go to students enrolled on a regular schedule. Daily drop in rates will be $17 per day, space allowing. A registration form must be completed for all students participating in the Afterschool Care Program.
Parents will be billed an additional $5.00 per minute late pick up fee for students picked up after 5:30pm.
