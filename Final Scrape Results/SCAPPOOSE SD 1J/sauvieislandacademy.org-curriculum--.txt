In implementing a Place-Based Education model we will utilize the following teaching and learning strategies:
• Project-Based and Cooperative Learning
• Thematic Instruction
• Direct Instruction
Place-Based Education will build on the education standards in language arts, mathematics, social studies, science and other subjects by emphasizing hands on real world learning into lessons. Students will begin by asking questions such as:
Where am I?
What is the natural history of this place?
How does this place fit into the larger world?
Students will be able to experience what they learn in a familiar context, thereby increasing their capacity to understand and communicate the subject matter. Research shows that the Place-Based Education approach to education increases academic achievement, help students become better problem solvers, as they come to understand the impact of their choices on the world around us and will empower students to make positive changes in their lives.
