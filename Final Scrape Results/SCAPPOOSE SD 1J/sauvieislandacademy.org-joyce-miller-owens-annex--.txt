Joyce Miller Owens Annex
Sauvie Island Academy Receives Donation of $850,000 to Build Classrooms
Sauvie Island Academy will have three new permanent classrooms for grades 6th-8th by next spring after receiving a generous donation to fund the project. 
The public charter school received $850,000 from the Joyce Miller Owens Charitable Foundation that will allow the school to build an annex containing three new classrooms for 6th, 7th and 8th-grade classes. The Joyce Miller Owens Charitable Foundation is a non-profit agency the contributed funding toward various projects in Oregon, with a focus on funding projects with concrete, visible results. 
These grades are currently set up in a portable classroom on the north end of the property, which the school leases. The 24-by-60-foot portable building is divided into three classrooms for students in the three upper-grade levels. In those classrooms, tables, chairs, lockers and classroom supplies are all organized into a limited amount of space which makes the rooms very crowded.  
“We have the biggest kids in the smallest space,” according to Director Meeuwsen. The new building will provide much bigger classrooms, a science lab, a large corridor away for lockers and small group work, a restroom, air conditioning and a ton of natural light. 
Currently, the SIA School Board is working with architects and designers from SUM Design and Architecture and an owner’s rep from inici group, Inc. to complete the project. They have received approval and permits from Multnomah County and are working to expedite permits through the City of Portland. 
The architects have created bids sets and the owner’s rep is working on a draft RRP to be prepared for the bid process, as soon as the permits are approved. Once the contractor is selected, the project will break ground. Construction will take place during the school year while school is in session because it does not displace any teachers, classrooms or students. SIA’s goal is to have the new building completed in the spring of 2018!
