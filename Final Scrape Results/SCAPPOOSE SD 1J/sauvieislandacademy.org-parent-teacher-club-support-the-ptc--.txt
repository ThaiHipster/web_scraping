As a public charter school, Sauvie Island Academy operates on a budget which is 40% less than a traditional public school. Charter school funding in Oregon relies heavily on the support of the school community and surrounding business.
Our parents, board members and staff are currently coming up with some exciting ways to help support the wonderful education opportunities for our students.
If you would like to make a tax deductible donation to the school please contact us via
