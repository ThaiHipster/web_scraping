You Can Make A Difference!
As a public charter school, Sauvie Island Academy receives only 80% of the State School Fund dollars. This reduces our funding by approximately $397,000 this 17-18 year. Therefore, our ability to 
purchase consumable items each year is a challenge.
Classroom Consumables Contribution
Each year, Sauvie Island Academy spends about $125 per child to provide the 
consumable supplies necessary to ensure your child’s continued success in the classroom. These 
consumable supplies differ for each grade level and include:
Transportation to and from field trips
Technological devices and Apps
Science supplies & journals
Periodicals like Scholastics News, Science World, Story Works
Paper,  printer ink, presentation boards
Garden and habitat supplies
Clay, Paints, Construction Paper
Other miscellaneous supplies
We would greatly appreciate a tax-deductible 
contribution 
from each family to help us cover the expense of these necessary items! Please consider providing a payment of $50 toward 
consumable classroom supplies. If this expense is prohibitive, please contact us to make alternative arrangements.
Your $50 donation can be made the following ways:
1. Contribute via the 
SIA PayPay Account
 link.
2. Send a check or cash to SIA with the memo “Consumable Contribution”
Thank you so much for your support!
