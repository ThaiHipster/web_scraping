Enrollment Policy
Our enrollment policy, dictated by state law, gives first priority to siblings of current students, then students residing on Sauvie Island, and then students residing within the Scappoose School District. In order to obtain sibling status, a sibling must be enrolled for the application year as well as the previous year. Priority does not apply for a sibling whose brother or sister is leaving the school in the year the sibling is entering the school. Students residing outside the District may apply for enrollment and be admitted if spaces are available after District applicants have enrolled.
Non-Discrimination Policy:  No applicant for enrollment as a student at Sauvie Island Academy shall be discriminated against in any educational program or activity  on the basis of race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, national origin, disability, terms of an Individualized Education Plan (IEP), income level, proficiency in the English language or athletic ability.  Placement at Sauvie Island Academy of any student receiving special education services pursuant to an individual Education Plan (IEP) must be approved by the student’s IEP team.
