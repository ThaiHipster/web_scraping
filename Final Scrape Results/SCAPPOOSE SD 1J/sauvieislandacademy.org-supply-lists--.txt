Classroom Consumables Contribution
Each year, Sauvie Island Academy spends $125 per child to provide the consumable supplies necessary to ensure your child’s success in the classroom. These consumable supplies differ for each grade level and include technological devices, paper and printer ink, science supplies, periodicals like Scholastics News, garden supplies, clay, paints, transportation to and from field trips, etc. It also covers educational apps including Keyboarding Without Tears, Raz Kids, Easy Tech; all of which meet important needs and national tech teaching standards. We would greatly appreciate a tax-deductible contribution from each family to help us cover the expense of these necessary items!
Please consider providing a payment of $50 toward consumable classroom supplies. You may also act as a sponsor for another student by increasing your payment.
