Welcome to Sauvie Island Academy!
We are a K-8 public charter school located on scenic Sauvie Island just outside of Portland, Oregon.

We give our students the opportunity to learn through the values of stewardship and by using the community and natural surroundings as a learning environment that extends beyond the classroom, immersing children in the local heritage and cultural landscape.
