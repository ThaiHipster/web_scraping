There are loads of ways to volunteer! Join us for a Monthly PTC Meetings on 3rd Thursday of every month!
Volunteer
Part of our mission at Sauvie Island Academy is to create a learning environment that students are engaged in and to have them feel connected to their community and become stewards of the environment. One way to achieve this goal, in addition to our Place-Based Education Model is to invest time into making our school a better place. This is done through building maintenance projects, classroom support and through various fundraising opportunities.
Showing community involvement through volunteerism will give Sauvie Island Academy an advantage when applying for grants and additional funding through the state and federal governments. It will also create a sense of school pride and ownership for our families, students and community members.
If you or someone you know would be interested in volunteering at our school, or would be an added value to our Place-Based Education curriculum, please have them complete our Volunteer Questionnaire so we are better able to understand how they would like to participate in the school.
All volunteers are required by the Oregon Department of Education to complete a Criminal Background Check prior to working in the school or with students. If you are interested in volunteering please 
download the background check
 form, complete and return to the school.
