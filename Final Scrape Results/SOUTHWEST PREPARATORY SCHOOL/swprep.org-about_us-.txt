About Us
SWPS History: An Era of Accomplishment
In 1998, Southwest Preparatory School opened its doors to 23 students and today there are over 800. We have become the largest charter high school in Bexar County with four campuses located in the populated areas of the Northeast, Northwest and Southeast sections of San Antonio, Texas. If the past is any indication of what the future can be, then our growth and enviable record of success with at-risk students during the past 14 years will continue- as well our determination to provide educational opportunities to students through tuition-free public elementary, middle and high school. 
A Mission of Purpose
The mission of the Southwest Preparatory School is to provide an adaptive and effective learning environment that will prepare students to succeed in the workplace and/or college.
A Vision of Excellence
The Vision for each student is to develop into a graduate who is self-motivated, employable, self-reliant, and optimistic about the ability to learn and possess citizenship and decision making skills as a result of incorporating the principles learned in character education.
