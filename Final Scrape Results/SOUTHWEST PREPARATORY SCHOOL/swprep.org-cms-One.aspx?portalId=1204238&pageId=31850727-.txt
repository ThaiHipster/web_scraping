Northwest Campus will be  Springing into College  for the 2017-2018 School Year
We are excited to announce that we are implementing an Early College High School Program on our campus.
What does this mean for you?  
Your student has the opportunity to earn free college hours starting their freshman year.
Stay tuned for details on our kickoff event in April!
Watch us grow! 
We will soon begin   expansion on our    current building to   include an additional classroom and cafeteria for the 2017-2018 year.  
We can also look forward to a gym and additional classrooms for the 2018-2019 year.
