Southwest Preparatory Scholarship Program
Beginning with the 2012-2013 school year, students enrolled in grades 6-12 at SWPS are eligible to earn a $300.00 college scholarship each semester (based on board approval of available funds).  For each semester that a student earns the scholarship, the funds will be placed in a non-transferable account.  When the student graduates from SWPS, all earned funds will be directed to the students college or university of choice. A student must request funds within 4 years of graduating.
To be eligible for the scholarship, a student must meet all of the following qualifications.  
​
1. The student must have completed all courses assigned to them at the beginning of the semester with a “B” average. A “B” is defined as a grade of 85 or greater. For students enrolled in self-paced courses, they must complete six courses during the semester.  
​
2. The student must have at least 95% attendance.
​
3. The students may not have any discipline records for the semester.
​
4. The student must pass all state administered tests or state approved substitutes that are administered during the semester.
By the time the student attending Southwest Preparatory School graduates, he or she will have earned up to $4,200 towards the college or university of their choice. At today’s college tuition rates, the money earned can be applied to two years of Junior College or supplemental aid to a larger university.
