Charter Schools
Accreditation
Southwest Schools is a State Charter School governed by the Texas Education Agency. As a Generation III Charter School, Southwest Schools was the first State Charter High School in the Houston area. Since we are funded through State and Federal programs, we have the same level of accountability as other schools in neighboring local districts. However, as a small charter school, we are able to provide innovative programs such as our E-Colors initiative with Chevron. Additionally, we are able to make improvements for students at a much more rapid rate than other larger, more bureaucratic school districts.
What is a charter school?
Charter schools are free public schools that have the flexibility to adapt to the educational needs of individual students. Charter schools vary in mission and model, serving a wide range of students, many with needs beyond the one-size-fits-all traditional public school. Often, charter schools provide a personalized learning environment that promotes greater student achievement. Although charter schools have some autonomy, they still must meet the rigorous academic standards dictated by the state for all public schools.
On charter campuses, school leaders are permitted more freedom in managing their school, allowing them to respond in the best interest of both parents and students. Teachers at charter schools are encouraged to structure lessons to the specific needs of their students. Some charter schools even provide curriculum that specializes in certain fields such as the arts, mathematics or science. Others provide a more efficient, general education based on the educational model set forth in the charter.
Charter schools offer free, quality non-traditional public education options.
How are charter schools funded?
Charter schools receive state funds based on the average daily attendance of students (as do traditional public schools); however, they do not receive funds from local tax revenue, and the majority, including Texas charters, do not receive state facilities funding.
What is the purpose of charter schools?
Charter schools exist to:
Improve student learning
Increase the choice of learning opportunities within the public school system
Create professional opportunities that will attract new teachers to the public school system
Establish a new form of accountability for public schools
Encourage different and innovative learning methods
