Child Find
Do you know of an infant, child, or adolescent who does not learn easily? All individuals develop at their own pace, but some have more difficulty than others. There is a way to make a difference for these children and adolescents.
What is Child Find?
Child Find is a process designed to identify, locate and evaluate individuals (birth through 21 years of age) with disabilities who may need special education services.
Who can begin the Child Find process?
Anyone can start the process: A parent, doctor, teacher, relative, or friend can call Southwest Schools.
Why should we refer a child?
Early identification and intervention can prevent failure and frustration. Providing special attention to teaching and learning strategies may help individuals overcome barriers to learning.
What happens after the individual is referred?
Southwest Schools’ personnel will reach out to the parent(s) or legal guardian, and together the parents (or legal guardian) and the school will decide if an assessment is needed. This same group may develop an assessment plan designed to evaluate areas of concern, and then the appropriate personnel will conduct an evaluation. Once this step is taken, the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and evaluation personnel will have a meeting to talk about assessment results, special education eligibility, and service options to determine the best course of action.
