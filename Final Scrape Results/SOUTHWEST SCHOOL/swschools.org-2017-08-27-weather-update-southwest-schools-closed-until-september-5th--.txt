WEATHER UPDATE:  Southwest Schools Closed Until September 11th
            Released                August 27th, 2017  |                    
Southwest Schools campuses will reopen for students on Monday September 11th due to widespread damage from Hurricane Harvey.
Administrative and non-instructional staff are set to return to work on Tuesday, September 5th and teachers are scheduled to return to work on Wednesday, September 6th.
 The safety of our staff, our students and their families is our top priority. The storms and heavy rains that affected parts of the city make conditions too dangerous for school to begin any sooner.
