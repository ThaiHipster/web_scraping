CHANGE TO FRIDAY HALF-DAY SCHEDULE
            Released                September 21st, 2017  |                    
STORY HIGHLIGHTS:  FULL DAY FRIDAYS | 1ST FRIDAY EVERY MONTH 1/2 DAY  |  NEW SCHEDULE TO BEGIN IN OCTOBER
Dear Parents/Guardians,
Please allow me to take this opportunity to thank you for a great school start. Despite the
devastating events of the past few weeks and the issues that families might have endured
during Harvey, students were present and excited about starting the new school year. We are
so glad to have your family in our Southwest Schools’ community. Together we will make this a
great year for our students!
As you may know, we lost nine school days as a result of the recent storm. Although the Texas
Educational Agency (TEA) is not requiring us to make up any of that lost instructional time, we
feel that it is in the best interest of our students to add instructional time back into the school
calendar. We are adding back the instructional time to provide the educational benefits our
students deserve.
To that end, we will transition to full day Fridays with one early release Friday each month. The
early release Friday will be the first Friday of each month. The change will begin in October.
I strongly feel that this is the right decision for our students. I believe that this will benefit
Southwest Schools’ students this year and in years to come. Recognizing that this represents a
significant change from past years of practice, we are asking for your support—both with the
school and with your children—with these changes.
You will receive additional correspondence regarding the changes and schedule for early release
days from your child’s campus. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact
your child’s campus principal.
Thank you for your continued support of Southwest Schools and for allowing us to be your
child’s school of choice.
All the best,
Janelle James,
Superintendent / CEO of Schools
