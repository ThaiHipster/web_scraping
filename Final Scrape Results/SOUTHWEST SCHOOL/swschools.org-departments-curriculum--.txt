Curriculum
Students will engage in activities that will build on their skills in reading, writing, math, science, social studies, and fine arts to further develop their academic abilities. In order to create college and career-ready students for postsecondary success we will meet the diverse needs of all students in an inclusive community that fosters a strong sense of self-worth.
Southwest Schools is committed to coordinating the written, taught and tested curriculum. To accomplish the district’s goals and objectives, the curriculum and instructional program will provide viable curriculum for each content area, train and support teachers for high-impact, high-yield instruction, and support the use of high quality assessments.
