Professional Learning
What is a Professional Learning Community?
Southwest Schools supports a collaborative culture that encourages our teachers to work together with the ultimate goal of constantly improving students’ ability to learn.
Professional Learning Community Resources
Equilibria E-Colors
Knowledge of E-Colors leads to a heightened awareness that we do not all think and act the same and that we all have different communication styles and behavioral tendencies that are often largely linked to our personality.
The E-Colors process helps to identify different personality styles, which enables people to better understand themselves and those around them.
Learn more about the E-Colors Program
Safe and Civil Schools
Safe and Civil Schools offers practical programs and inspiring staff development services that help our teachers:
Develop better behavior management strategies in schools.
Learn effective classroom management procedures.
Implement school-wide Positive Behavior Support and Response-to-Intervention for Behavior.
Design and implement a better school improvement plan.
The end result is an environment that allows students to focus on learning.
