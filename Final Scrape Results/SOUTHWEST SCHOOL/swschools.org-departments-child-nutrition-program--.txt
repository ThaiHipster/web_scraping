Child Nutrition Program
Students at Southwest Schools are served a wide variety of meals that are delicious and nutritionally sound. Meals are analyzed for nutritional content and meet the RDA (recommended daily amount) for each age/grade level. The Southwest Child Nutrition Program is self-supported by the money from meal services. In addition, Southwest Schools receives reimbursement from the federally funded National School Breakfast and National School Lunch programs and commodities from the United States Department of Agriculture.
