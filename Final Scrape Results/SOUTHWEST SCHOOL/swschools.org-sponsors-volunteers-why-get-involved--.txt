Why Get Involved
“Education is the most powerful leverage points for breaking the generations-old, self-perpetuating cycle of poverty and solving other challenging socio-economic problems.”
Why Get Involved?
Southwest Schools has something very special to offer our students and we are making a difference in their lives as well as those around them.
We do a lot of great things for our students with 60% less than traditional districts.  With the help of our current supporters, we have been afforded the opportunity to do some remarkable things.
With your help, we can continue to provide a quality education, and add even more programs and resources for our students.
How can you help?
Sponsorships & Donations
Even with dramatically less in funding, we are expected to provide the same services to our students as traditional programs.  This is where we need your help.
Volunteer
Each of our campus has specific needs that can’t be easily filled through current staffing.  Whether it’s lending your unique skills to augment the fine arts program or helping in the library, we welcome the chance to have you work with us.
Other Opportunities
Financial Literacy Programs for parents and students
Supplemental Education and Adjunct Professorships
Intern Programs
Books and Supply Donations
There are lots of ways to get involved and make a direct impact on the lives of the students at Southwest.  Contact us at 713-784-6345 or info@swschools.org and ask to speak to someone about ways you can get involved.
