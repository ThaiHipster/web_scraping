            Released                September 1st, 2017  |                    
Southwest Cares
The Southwest Schools family pledges to support one another in the aftermath of the devastating floods caused by Hurricane Harvey. Join with us to help the student families and staff members  impacted by this terrible disaster. 
Dear Southwest Schools Community,
As we transition from the impact of such an historic event as Hurricane Harvey to creating a new normalcy in our district for our staff, students, and parents, my thoughts continue to be with you for peace, safety and strength. The recovery from such a devastating weather event is never easy, yet I am comforted by the compassion and humanity of people like our Southwest community.
The next few weeks and the ongoing recovery of our region will be long and difficult. As is our culture, the Southwest Schools family will support one another and we’ll get through this together.
We invite you to donate to the relief effort that will directly aid our student families and staff members who have been impacted by this terrible disaster.
Please continue to check the districts website at http://www.swschools.org, Facebook, and Twitter to obtain important updates regarding the start of school and information and resources to support you and your family during this unexpected transitional time. If you have any questions or need to leave a message for your campus you can respond by email to info@swschools.org.
These recent bright skies give us a renewed sense of hope and are a reminder that our community is full of light and love; let’s continue to lean on each other!
All the best,
Janelle James, Superintendent/CEO of Schools
and
Dr. Spyros Catechis, Founder/CEO
