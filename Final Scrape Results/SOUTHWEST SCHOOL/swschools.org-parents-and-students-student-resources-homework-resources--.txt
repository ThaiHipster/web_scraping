Homework Resources
The Texas Education Agency (TEA) has developed State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness  (STAAR) study guides to help students strengthen the skills that are taught in class and tested on in STAAR. The guides are designed for students to use on their own or for students and families to work through together. Concepts are presented in a variety of ways that help students review the information and skills they need to be successful on the STAAR.
