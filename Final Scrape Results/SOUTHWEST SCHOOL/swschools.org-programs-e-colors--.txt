E-Colors
E-Colors
A student sits in tears, recounting his previous night’s struggle trying to find just one reason to get up the next day.  A passionate teacher, who believes in her students, faces the brink of hope lost in reaching him; she can’t understand why he is so withdrawn or why he no longer cares about his education, or more importantly, himself.  The student, in contrast, can’t understand why his teacher keeps trying to know him; he is an outcast, he doesn’t understand or even like himself, so why does she care more than he does?
Unfortunately, this scenario occurs all too often. Both the student and the teacher are communicating to each other, but the messages are lost because their individual personality characteristics drive message delivery and comprehension.
It can be said that at the core of any developing person, adult or child, is the desire to feel understood and accepted by both self and others.  The recognition and acceptance of an individual’s strengths and potential limitations can be invaluable.  This knowledge can be equally as beneficial in the understanding of others that have both similar and different personality characteristics.
The Challenge of Understanding
Students not only face the challenge of academics at school, but also the challenges of learning to understand themselves and others in the midst of puberty, social and peer pressure, and identity development.  Unfortunately, many adolescents go through their entire school careers without the benefit of experiencing the empowerment that self-acceptance and diversity can offer.  An important aspect of an education at Southwest Schools is the acquisition of social and communication skill sets that serve as a foundation for the rest of a student’s life.
What is E-Colors
E-colors is a methodology for identifying different personality styles. Based on a four color Personality Diversity Indicator, E-colors is designed to help individuals learn about their behaviors in order to improve communication skills, build better relationships and work more efficiently.
E-Colors is a foundation program at Southwest Schools intended to heighten personal and interpersonal awareness; fostering growth, communication skills, and socio-emotional and academic success.  This method is simple and effective and allows individuals to have a greater understanding themselves and those around them.
We all have all four E-Colors within us. No E-Color combination is better than any other.
Most people tend to have primary and secondary predominant E-Colors.
Utilizing this model there are 12 different E-Color combinations.
A person’s E-Color combination tends to influence his or her communication style and behavioral tendencies.
There are numerous benefits that can be gained by having an awareness of this, from improved communications to enhanced performance and teamwork to better risk management and mitigation.
Appreciating the value of all E-Color perspectives gives us an opportunity to benefit from the DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT
What Are Your E-Colors?
To find out what your E-Colors are you need to take the Personality Diversity Indicator (PDI). The PDI consists of 35 questions and will take you approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete.

E-Colors at Southwest Schools
Every student, teacher and staff member takes the E-Colors PDI at the beginning of each school year and is mentored on how to understand their results.
E-Champs offer peer mentorship in regards to the development and furthering of the E-Colors program including Personal Intervention. These special E-Champs are a select group of students who show leadership potential and the desire for awareness of self and others.
E-Radars are students on the radar to becoming E-Champs. They possess the desire for understanding, and are still gaining knowledge and experience with E-Colors and Personal Intervention. These students attend E-Champ meetings and activities to gain experience.
Campus teachers and administrators volunteer to become E-Staff members as a means of supporting the E-Colors program at both a district and individual campus level.
