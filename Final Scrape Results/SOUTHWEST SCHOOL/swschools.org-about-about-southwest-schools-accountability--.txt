Southwest Schools Receives “SUPERIOR” Rating
The Southwest School District has received a Rating of “SUPERIOR” from the Texas Education Agency for its 2015-2016 fiscal year School FIRST (Financial Integrity Rating System of Texas) for its excellence in fiscal management according to state guidelines.
Southwest Schools business department continues to strive for excellence and transparency. This state award is evident that employees are committed to financial responsibility and to meeting state guidelines. The School First Report is based on 20 indicators which gives a district a numerical value. The purpose of the financial accountability rating system, known as the School Financial Integrity Rating System of Texas (FIRST), is to ensure that open-enrollment charter schools are held accountable for the quality of their financial management practices and that they improve those practices. The system is designed to encourage Texas public and charter schools to better manage their financial resources in order to provide the maximum allocation possible for direct instructional purposes. To view the 2013-2014 District Status Detail report, click the document below.
Accountability for public schools in Texas is conducted and managed by the Texas Education Agency (TEA) through various measures or systems to determine the effectiveness of districts, charter schools, and campuses in (1) supporting student achievement and (2) managing data, information, programs, and financial aspects of the school system.
