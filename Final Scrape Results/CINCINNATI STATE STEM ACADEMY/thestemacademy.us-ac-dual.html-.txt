College Credit Plus
Earn College Credit In Your High School
Cincinnati State STEM Academy combines high quality high school instruction with the opportunity to take Cincinnati State classes for both high school and college credit. Our teachers have excellent credentials. Our College Credit Plus agreement with Cincinnati State means students are able to take college level courses, taught by college instructors with real-world experience, and the best part... free!
Every course taken through our College Credit Plus program also counts toward high school graduation. Students benefit by taking college courses in the same building as The STEM Academy. Successful students gain access to an official college transcript that can be sent to the college of their choice or incorporated into one of the certificate or degree curricula offered by Cincinnati State. Many of Cincinnati State’s College Credit Plus courses are included in the Ohio Transfer Assurance Guide (TAG) and Ohio’s Transfer Module. This allows students to determine how these courses can be applied at other Ohio public colleges and universities.
Students who participate in high school College Credit Plus can transition to college with increased confidence, having already proven that they can succeed in courses at that level. Such students graduate from high school with a realistic idea of what college requires. This, in turn, can provide a measure of comfort for parents.
