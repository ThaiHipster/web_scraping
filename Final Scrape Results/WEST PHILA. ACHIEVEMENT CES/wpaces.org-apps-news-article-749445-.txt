				WPACES Cares about Sickle Cell			
						WPACES will hold two fundraising activities for Sickle Cell Awareness.					
We are excited to announce that the tickets for our sickle cell bowling fundraiser are now on sale for purchase at the main office and admin office. To help us raise funds for this worthy cause, we are asking for each family to sell at least three tickets to this event at $20 per ticket. Food & Drinks will be included. There will also be a special Prize given to our top ticket sellers. Again, this event will take place Saturday, September 30 at the Elmwood bowling alley from 5 to 8 PM.
Our school-wide sickle cell walk will take place on September 22 during school hours. This day will be a schoolwide dress-down day. As always, students should bring one dollar to dress down. We are all wearing the color purple on this day! We are also still looking for volunteers for these two events.
Thank you again for all of your support and we look forward to a successful fundraiser.
