McKinney-Vento Act Information
If your family lives in any of the following situations:
In a shelter
In a motel or campground due to the lack of an alternative adequate accommodation
In a car, park, abandoned building, or bus or train station
Doubled up with other people due to loss of housing or economic hardship
Your school-age children may qualify for certain rights and protections under the federal McKinney-Vento Act.  Your eligible children have the right to: 
Receive a free, appropriate public education.
Enroll in school immediately, even if lacking documents normally required for enrollment.
Enroll in school and attend classes while the school gathers needed documents.
Enroll in the local school; or continue attending their school of origin (the school they attended when permanently housed or the school in which they were last enrolled), if that is your preference and is feasible.
Receive transportation to and from the school of origin, if you request this.
Receive educational services comparable to those provided to other students, according to your children's needs.
If you need further assistance with your children's educational needs, please contact Stephanie Berol, School Counselor, at 215-476-6471 ext 314.  The full explanation of the federal McKinney-Vento Act can be found at this link:
