Dr. Stacy R. Gill-Phillips
West Philadelphia Achievement Charter Elementary School - Meet Our CEO
Dr. Phillips received her Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration Management from Pennsylvania State University, her Master’s degree in Elementary Education & Curriculum Instruction from Temple University, and her Doctor’s degree in Educational Leadership from University of Pennsylvania.
Prior to serving at WPACES, Dr. Phillips worked in corporate America as a financial analyst for a number of years assessing the overall condition of businesses earning $5 million dollars or more. She also assessed the viability, cash flow, marketing, finance management, net worth, sales management structure and overall stability of businesses. After the analysis was done she would then assigned the Dunn & Brad Street rating. In 1990, she established Pee Wee Prep Educational Center in Philadelphia where she serves pre-school, before and after school care to the community.
At WPACES, Dr. Phillips developed the school’s charter, and handled all aspects of the start-up process including financing, complying with government procedures, making policies, hiring professionals, enrolling students and more. Her objective is to directly and indirectly impact the education of children through a quality educational experience. She is the master-mind of the school, and takes pride in all of her students’ success.
