Celebrations
Science Night was a fun night of science coming to life! Thank you to our WAVE team for hosting the event, and to all of our families who participated. 
Congratulations to Miss Brunnmeier’s class who had the highest percentage of walkers participating in Walktober. Their class won a check for $114.62, equal to half the total school’s gas savings over the month. Thank you, Explorers, for putting your best foot forward with Walktober!
Thanks to our WAVE team for collecting donations for the Olympic Triathlon on Tuesdays at the Maybrook gate. Thank you to so many families who have already participated. Keep it up!

WAVE
BASE is Open Conference Week:
  All grades have early dismissal for the week of conferences, November 13-17th. Kindergarten will dismiss at 1:00pm and 1st-8th grade will dismiss at 1:30pm. BASE will be open all week until 6:00 pm. BASE is also open on Monday (11/20) and Tuesday (11/21) of Thanksgiving Break. 
Click HERE
 for details of our BASE program.
Parent Survey: The Parent Survey will be taken at the end of each trimester this year so we can measure growth throughout the year. 
Click HERE
 to answer six questions to rate your family’s experience at Westlake Charter School during the 2017-18 school year.
Walktober results are in: 
During the month of October, students at Westlake Charter School walked to school, 1,763 miles
, travelling across America past Des Moines, Iowa
!  Over the course of the month, students made 3,085 trips to school by foot, prevented 1,355 lbs of CO2 from being released into the air, and saved 71 gallons of gas, on the morning walks alone.  WOW!  It goes to show that together, small steps make a big difference!  Keep up the momentum – walk and bike to school ALL YEAR LONG, and earn prizes while you are at it.
Lost and Found:
 Our lost and found is overflowing with jackets, lunch boxes, water bottles and more! Please check for any missing items by Friday, November 17th. All unclaimed items will be donated over Thanksgiving Break.
Academic Awards Ceremony:
  As we build our K-8 school culture, we are designing the Academic Awards ceremony to be an annual K-8 event. At the end of the year, all grade levels will have a chance to celebrate student’s academic and social emotional growth. We will not have a trimester awards ceremony; however, 6th-8th grade students who have earned Distinguished Honor Roll, Principal’s List, or Honor roll will receive certificates during their student led conferences.
Parents Go To School Night: 
Save the date for Parents Go To School Night on Jan. 31st from 5:30-8pm. This is an evening where Westlake teachers and staff present workshop sessions just for you! Please consider providing feedback by

 on what sessions you would be interested in seeing.

still collecting checks and cash at the Maybrook entrance on Tuesday mornings from 8-8:40am. Students will receive prizes and recognition based on online and in person donations.
Olympic Triathlon: 
Olympic Triathlon is in full swing and students have been so excited to hear about which class receives the Olympic torch and which class wins a donut party. Students receive a raffle entry for every $20 collected with no maximum. Two donut parties (one Elementary and one Middle) will be awarded every week! There will be prizes for students meeting their personal goal, classes with 100% participation and top earners. 
Have you had a chance to checkout our new online donation system? You are able to personalize a family donation site to email or text to friends and family, post on social media or show to coworkers. Please visit 
http://pledgestar.com/westlakecharter
 to set up your family donation page. You can customize it with student name(s), a photo and donation goal. You then quickly set it up to send an email explaining why WCS is amazing and how they can help us meet our goal this year. Families have been amazed at the simplicity of set up and donation collections.
