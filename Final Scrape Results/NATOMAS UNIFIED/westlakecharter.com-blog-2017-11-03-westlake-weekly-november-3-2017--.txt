Celebrations
Thank you families for being so engaged in our school! Whether you are volunteering at school, attending an event or sharing a celebration like these parents at this week’s Coffee Talk, it is always wonderful to see WCS families collaborating with our school!
We are excited to announce our explorer gym is now open!! On Friday, we held our first PE classes in the gym just in time for the rainy season.
Mrs. McIver uses the workshop to provide individualized instruction to her students. This week during a workshop she was able to meet with almost half her class in small groups to tackle a common error students were making in subtraction.

Academic Awards Ceremony:

At the end of the year, all grade levels will have a chance to celebrate student’s academic and social emotional growth. We will not have a trimester awards ceremony; however, 6th-8th grade students who have earned Distinguished Honor Roll, Principal’s List, or Honor roll will receive certificates during their student led conferences.

Thank you to all of the families who joined us at Lawrence Hall of Science’s presentation of Solids, Liquids and Gases. We hope you enjoyed an exciting evening of entertainment, education and community!
Olympic Triathlon: 
You have probably been hearing a lot about the Olympic Triathlon but may not be sure what exactly it is. The Olympic Triathlon is our biggest fundraiser of the year. It isn’t just about fundraising but is also about celebrating what sets us apart from so many other schools. Our three specialties of Art, PE and Spanish! This year we will be fundraising to customize our beautiful new campus with things like shade, soccer goals and bike racks. 
On Thursday, November 30
th
 our students will participate in a special day of learning on the Olympic Triathlon Event Day. This day is completely staffed and planned by our parent volunteers alongside some fabulous WCS staff members. We need your help to make this day fun and successful for our school and students. Please be on the lookout for an event day sign up soon. In the meantime, if you would like to get involved with planning please contact Amber Hustead, WAVE President, at 
amberhustead@gmail.com
. We currently need help planning the obstacle course, making class flags and more. 
Have you had a chance to checkout our new online donation system? You are able to personalize a family donation site to send to friends and family, post on social media or show to co-workers in the office. Please visit 
http://pledgestar.com/westlakecharter
 to set up your family donation page. You can customize it with student name(s), a photo and donation goal. You then quickly set it up to send an email explaining why WCS is amazing and how they can help us meet our goal this year. 
Our school wide goal is to have each student contribute $180 which represents $1 for every day of school. We encourage families to give what they can whether it is less or more than the goal amount. We are striving for 100% participation from all students to contribute at least $5 towards our Olympic Triathlon Fundraising efforts. 
We will be collecting checks and cash at the Maybrook entrance on Tuesday mornings from 8-8:40am. Students will receive prizes and recognition based on online and in person donations.
