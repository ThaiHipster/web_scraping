Olympic Triathlon Fundraising: 
The Olympic Triathlon has raised over $20,000 so far! Way to go, Explorers! Additionally, students have been extremely excited to hear about which class receives the Olympic torch for the highest donations that week. It has also been very exciting to award a donut party to two students each week to share with their entire class. Students receive a raffle entry for every $20 collected with no maximum. Two donut parties (one Elementary and one Middle) will be awarded every week with the final drawing taking place on November 29th! There will be prizes for students meeting their personal goal, classes with 100% participation and top earners. 
It has been wonderful to see all of the creative ways families have been fundraising. The Thanksgiving holiday is the perfect time to collect donations from family and friends and work towards the goal of $180 per student. That is just $1 per school day! Our school wide goal of 100% participation is what’s most important though. We hope every student can raise at least $5 to get us there and help your class win a party for reaching 100% participation!
Have you created your family online donation site? You are able to personalize a family donation site to email or text to friends and family, post on social media or show to coworkers. Please visit 
http://pledgestar.com/westlakecharter
 to set up your family donation page. You can customize it with student name(s), a photo and donation goal. You then quickly set it up to send an email explaining why WCS is amazing and how they can help us meet our goal this year. You can even send a reminder email to those who haven’t had a chance to donate yet! Families have been seeing wonderful results with this new system. We apologize for the glitch with the donation request letter last week but PledgeStar addressed the issue and it is now resolved.
Our final in person collection is Tuesday, November 28
th
 at Maybrook entrance from 8-8:40am. You can also drop checks or cash into the lockbox located in the front office. Receipts are available at both collection sites. 
Olympic Triathlon Event Day: 
On Thursday, November 30th our students will participate in a special day of learning on the Olympic Triathlon Event Day. This day is completely staffed and planned by our parent volunteers alongside some fabulous WCS staff members. We need your help to make this day fun and successful for our school and students.
