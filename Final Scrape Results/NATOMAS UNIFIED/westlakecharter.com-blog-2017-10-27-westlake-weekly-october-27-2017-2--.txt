Celebrations
Our WAVE team set the bar high with their first event on our new campus. Thank you to every family who donated, volunteered, and participated in the Fall Festival!
Students in Mrs. Chastain’s class practiced a moment of mindful breathing during a math lesson. Mrs. Chastain is a master of using Teacher Language to refocus and recenter her students to get the most out of every learning opportunity. 
Westlake Charter students and staff enjoyed a week of fun and learning focusing on making healthy and responsible choices! Ask your student to share a highlight from their Red Ribbon week!

Olympic Triathlon: 
Our 10
th
 annual Westlake Charter Olympic Triathlon is here! The Triathlon is not just about fundraising. It is about celebrating our three specialties of Art, PE and Spanish. This year we will be fundraising to customize our beautiful new campus with things like shade, soccer goals and bike racks. 
On Thursday, November 30
th
 our students will participate in a special day of learning on the Olympic Triathlon Event Day. This day is completely staffed and planned by our parent volunteers alongside some fabulous WCS staff members. We need your help to make this day fun and successful for our school and students. Please be on the lookout for an event day sign up soon. In the meantime, if you would like to get involved with planning please contact Amber Hustead, WAVE President, at 
amberhustead@gmail.com
. We currently need help planning the obstacle course, making class flags and more. 
This year we are rolling out a new online donation system for you to easily send a donation request to friends and family. Please visit 
http://pledgestar.com/westlakecharter
 to set up a family donation page. You can customize it with student name(s), a photo and donation goal. You then quickly set it up to send an email explaining why WCS is amazing and how they can help us meet our goal this year. 
Our school wide goal is to have each student contribute $180 which represents $1 for every day of school. We encourage families to give what they can whether it is less or more than the goal amount. We are striving for 100% participation from all students to contribute at least $5 towards our Olympic Triathlon Fundraising efforts. 
Over the years families have come up with many creative ways to fundraise during the Olympic Triathlon. Some ideas include: making and selling items, a lemonade or hot cocoa stand, sending a video about why they love WCS to potential donors, garage sales and more. You can raise money any way that works for your family!
We will be collecting checks and cash at the Mabry entrance on Tuesday mornings from 8-8:40am. Students will receive prizes and recognition based on online and in person donations. We will also be available at Science Night to help you setup your donation page, collect donations and answer any questions. 
Please review the documents sent home with your Explorer and let us know if you have any questions about the Olympic Triathlon. Thank you for your continued support!
