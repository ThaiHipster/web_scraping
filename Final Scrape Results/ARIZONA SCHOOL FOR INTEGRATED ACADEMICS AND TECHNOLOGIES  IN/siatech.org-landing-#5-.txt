THE FUTURE
Operating on a modest annual budget, we have been fortunate to expand our network of campuses and programs. Now, however, public funding is on the decline. Yet our goal is clear: to graduate 2,000 more students who are out-of-school and out-of options each year.
Through new funding sources, we can achieve that goal. Our team is ready to explain how. Contact us today.
