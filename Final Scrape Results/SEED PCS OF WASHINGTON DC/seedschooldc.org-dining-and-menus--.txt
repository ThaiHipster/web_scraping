PUBLIC NOTIFICATION NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM
2017-2018 school year
The SEED School of Washington, D.C. is currently participating in the District of Columbia’s National School Breakfast, Lunch and Snack Program. The program follows USDA meal pattern requirements, rules and regulations. 
Studies have shown that children whose nutritional needs are met have fewer attendance and discipline problems and are more attentive in class. A good school breakfast and lunch is not only essential to academic achievement, but is also part of a child’s general health and wellness. 
If interested in providing your child with a high-quality education and nutritious meals, please contact Ken Arndt at 
karndt@seedschooldc.org
  or 202.248.7773 ext. 3006
