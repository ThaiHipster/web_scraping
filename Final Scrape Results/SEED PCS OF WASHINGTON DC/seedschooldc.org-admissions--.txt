2017-18 Student Registration
Thank you for your interest in The SEED School of Washington, D.C.--the nation’s first, public, college-preparatory, tuition-free boarding school. Our mission is to provide an outstanding, intensive educational program that prepares children, both academically and socially, for success in college and beyond. Our five-day boarding program requires that enrolled students arrive on Sunday evenings for check-in and on Friday afternoons, check out for the weekend, at the conclusion of the academic day. Boarding requirements are consistent with exceptions of holidays and other school closings.
We hope that you have had a chance to look through our website to see how we fulfill our mission and why over 90% of our SEED graduates have been accepted to four-year colleges and universities.
If your child could benefit from a college-preparatory curriculum, varied exposure and extracurricular opportunities, a structured program and deep sense of community fostered by a boarding school, your child might be a good fit for SEED.
