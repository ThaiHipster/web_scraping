Athletics
The SEED School of DC supports the philosophy that a quality athletic program is vital to the positive social, physical, and educational development of students. The athletic program enhances and supports the academic mission of SEED.  We are committed to promoting the proper idea of sportsmanship, ethical conduct, and fair play at all athletic contest.
Athletics at SEED are meant to develop an introductory to the following ten qualities: character, sportsmanship, self-confidence, teamwork, unselfishness, responsibility, leadership, competitive spirit, decision-making, and physical skills through the process of hard work, commitment and loyalty.

TEAM SCHEDULES
Check  back soon for updated team schedules!
PARTICIPATION
Participation in sports is a voluntary privilege. Such participation will always be based on healthy competition between team members for starting positions and playing time. An attitude of entitlement, on the part of any team member, has absolutely no place in any of our athletic programs. We offer a wide range of sports, including volleyball, flag-football, soccer, cheerleading, basketball, softball, baseball, tennis, and track. The SEED School of DC competes in the Public Charter School Athletic Association (PCSAA).
ELIGIBILITY
Academic Requirements: A student-athlete in grade nine (9), ten (10), eleven (11), or twelve (12) shall have a grade point average of at least 2.0 (“C”).
A student-athlete in grade four (4), five (5), six (6), seven (7), or eight (8) shall not fail more than one (1) subject at the end of the grading period immediately preceding the sport season in which the student athlete wishes to participate.
