Following completion of the Gate, students in grades nine through twelve undertake a traditional college-preparatory curriculum, including Advanced Placement courses, in a block schedule that introduces them to the course scheduling they will encounter in college. The SEED School offers a wide range of elective courses, such as entrepreneurship, service learning, and journalism, that build upon the core content courses and provide a more challenging and enriching learning experience in the subjects that interest students most.

College preparedness
SEED students are college-bound! By providing resources, instruction, and guidance to the greater SEED community, the College Café fosters this college-bound culture at SEED and directly supports students and their parents through the college admissions process. 
The College Café conducts intensive seminar courses for juniors and seniors, helping them navigate college application requirements and submit all documentation. Students receive assistance with application essays, compiling their personal portfolios, and SAT preparation.
The Café also prepares families for the challenges of financing colleges, holding workshops on financial literacy and saving, financial aid and the FAFSA, and scholarship opportunities. 
Exposure to colleges and universities is critical for students’ understanding of schools’ expectations of them, as well as what they should look for in their own post-secondary choice. A hallmark of SEED DC's program is a college tour for juniors, when students travel to visit eight to ten different types of schools, including large state universities, small liberal arts colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, schools in city-centers and schools in rural communities. From the time students enter SEED, they will take many day trips to colleges in D.C. and the surrounding area, but the junior tour is essential in helping students make their final college decision. Check out photos of SEED DC's 2016 junior tour to Binghamton University, Lafayette College, Penn State University, Princeton University, Shippensburg University, Temple University, University of Pittsburgh, and University of Rochester!
