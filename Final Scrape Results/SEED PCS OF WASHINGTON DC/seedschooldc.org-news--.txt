Important Health Related Matter: 11/9/2017
Rashida Holman-Jones
November  9, 2017
Dear Parent or Guardian:
 This is to inform you that a case of Scabies exposure, of a middle school female scholar, has been reported to The SEED School of Washington, D.C. As a precaution, all families must take home all bedding and clothing to be washed and dried in high heat. 
 The signs and symptoms, mode of transmission and incubation period are as follows:
 Signs and Symptoms
: An infectious disease of the skin with itching caused by a mite that burrows under the skin and lays its eggs.  A rash, which consists of raised tracts. Bumps or blisters may appear.  Most common sites on the body are finger webs (in between fingers), wrists, elbows, armpits, waistline, thighs and genitalia.  Itching is most intense at night.
 Mode of Transmission
: Transfer of parasite by direct skin to skin contact or exchange of clothing/bedding. 
 Incubation Period
: 2 to 6 weeks before itching occurs or 1 to 4 days after re-exposure.
 Should your child present any of these symptoms, we recommend that you consult your family healthcare provider.
 SEED PCS will be monitoring students for signs and if any students present them they will be sent home pending medical treatment. Any student presenting with these signs and symptoms will be sent home pending medical treatment. Students must have a note from a healthcare provider stating they are under treatment and affected areas of the skin must be covered in order to return to school.
 If you have any questions, please call the Wellness Suite at 202-248-7773 ext. 5013.  Our top priority is to keep all scholars safe and healthy. Please refer to the full Department of Health information sheet on the back of this document.  Thank you for your attention to this very important matter.  
 Sincerely,
Rashida K. Holman-Jones, MSA
Director of Family and Community Engagement | The SEED Public Charter School of Washington, D.C.
