FROM VIRGINIA (Interstate 395):
Traveling North on I-395, cross the Potomac River on the 14th Street Bridge. Stay to the left as you cross and start to look for signs to 295. (Note: Do NOT take the Interstate 395 Tunnel.) Follow signs toward 295 and the Pennsylvania Avenue, SE exit, where the highway ends. Turn right on Pennsylvania Avenue and cross the Anacostia River via the John Philips Sousa Bridge. At the second stoplight, turn left onto Minnesota Avenue (there are two left turn lanes at this intersection). Travel about 1 mile on Minnesota Avenue and turn right on Ely Place (stoplight). Travel 0.6 miles on Ely, across Ridge Road (second stop sign), and continue following Ely/E down the hill. Turn left onto 40th Place/Burns Street. SEED DC is located straight ahead on the corner of Burns Street and C Street, SE.
FROM VIRGINIA (Route 66):

SEED DC is at the end of the street, at the corner of C and Burns Streets.
FROM MARYLAND:
Take the Baltimore-Washington Parkway (295) towards Washington. Bear to the left when 295 divides – do not bear right to Route 50/downtown Washington.
