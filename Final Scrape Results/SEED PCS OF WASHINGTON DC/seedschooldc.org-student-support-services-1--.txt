At The SEED School of Washington, D.C., we believe that rigor and support must go hand in hand. The Student Support Services vision is to provide a continuum of tiered, coordinated support services (medical, emotional, behavioral, and academic) so that students with varying needs are successful at SEED, in college and in life. Student Support Services at SEED include: the Wellness Suite, the Counseling Team, Special Education Services, Section 504, and Sex Education.
