Fort Worth Can Academy – Westcreek Principal’s Message
Dear Parents and Guardians,
Thank you for visiting Fort Worth Can Academy-Westcreek’s website!
I want to work with you in order for your student to have the very best educational experience. I feel fortunate to have the opportunity to nurture and support a dynamic learning community that works collaboratively to strengthen the academic and social achievement of students and the relationship between home, school, and community.
I have been connected to Fort Worth Can Academy since 2002. First, as a math teacher for four years. Next, I was the Assistant Principal of Curriculum and Instruction for three years. Finally in 2009, I became the Principal at this very campus.
I received my bachelor’s degree from Texas Wesleyan University and went on to attain a masters in educational administration from Prairie View A&M University.
I have lived in Fort Worth for most of my life. My husband, Richard and I are the proud parents of three children.
It is an honor that you have chosen our school as your student’s vessel to success!
Sincerely,
Ku-Masi Lewis
