2017-2018 Bus Transportation Forms
The 2017-2018 Transportation Registration Form was made available in May 2017.  Stillwater Area Public Schools provides bus transportation for St. Croix Prep students.  If you have yet to sign up for bus transportation, complete the 
Transportation Registration Form
.  Please email the form to 
schoolbus@stillwaterschools.org
 or mail it to:  Stillwater Area Public Schools, Transportation Department, 1875 S. Greeley Street, Stillwater MN  55082.  If you have any questions, please contact the Transportation Department of Stillwater Area Public Schools at 651-351-8377.  The bus transportation processing and routing is handled by Stillwater (ISD 834), so do NOT return your completed forms to St. Croix Prep.  Thank you for your attention to this.
Homework Expectations
All St. Croix Prep students, with the exception of Kindergarten students, should expect daily homework.  St. Croix Prep intends to make homework purposeful and aligned with the goals of delivering a college preparatory education.  As a general homework guideline, Middle School students may receive between 1.5 hours  and 2 hours of homework per night.  These are only guidelines.  Homework should be completed in a quiet environment free from technology distractions.  In addition, these guidelines do not take into consideration critical times of the year (e.g. mid or end of quarter) when additional time may be needed for project completion or test preparation.  These average estimates do not consider individual student learning styles, needs, efficiencies, or family educational goals (e.g. grades, college/university aspirations, etc.).  In the event a student is experiencing more homework than these guidelines, please contact the appropriate teacher and/or the School Principal for a homework log.  Click here for
