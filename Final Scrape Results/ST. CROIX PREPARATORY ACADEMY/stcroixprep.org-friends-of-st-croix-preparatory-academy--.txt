Friends of St. Croix Preparatory Academy
Friends of St. Croix Preparatory Academy (FSCPA) is a legally separate 501c3 organization formed to design and implement St. Croix Prep’s strategies related to facilities.  Click here for a copy of

.  In 2008, after investigating numerous acreage sites for the School’s permanent site, FSCPA has selected a 58 acre site at 4260 Stagecoach Trail North as the site for school construction.
On July 31, 2008, FSCPA issued bonds ($21.7 million) for the new school construction. Partners involved in this bond transaction included Dougherty & Company, Best & Flanagan, Briggs and Morgan, Wells Fargo, and Baytown Township.  The School was designed by Kodet Architectural Group and constructed by Adolfson & Peterson Construction.
On August 15, 2012, FSCPA issued bonds ($5 million) for expansion of the school facilities.  Partners involved in this bond transaction included Dougherty & Co, Best & Flanagan, Briggs and Morgan, Wells Fargo, and Baytown Township.  The expansion was designed by Pope Architects and is being constructed by Adolfson & Peterson.
On August 30, 2016, FSCPA refunded the 2008 and 2012 bonds and issued additional bonds ($4 million) for the development of athletic fields on the school property.  These plans include an 8 lane track, a competitive artificial turf field, two natural turf fields, and a building to accommodate potential overflow for baseball, softball, archery, golf, physical education classes, and recess.  The project began in the Spring of 2017, is currently in progress and will be completed by the middle of October 2017.
FSCPA 2017-2018 Board Meeting Schedule
