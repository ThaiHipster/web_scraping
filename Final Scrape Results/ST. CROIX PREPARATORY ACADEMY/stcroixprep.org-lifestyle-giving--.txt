Lifestyle Giving
Small changes in your lifestyle can add up to big giving to SCPA.
It doesn’t take much effort and has no cost to you, so if you’re willing to make a few changes in your lifestyle you can give back to SCPA.
Lifestyle Giving has grown out of the many programs available to schools.  These programs require only a little bit of planning on your part and absolutely no additional spending.  Check out the links below to see if you can make some small changes to benefit our school.
