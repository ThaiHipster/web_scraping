Homework Expectations
All St. Croix Prep students, with the exception of Kindergarten students, should expect daily homework.  St. Croix Prep intends to make homework purposeful and aligned with the goals of delivering a college preparatory education.  As a general homework guideline, Upper School students may receive between 2 hours  and 3 hours of homework per night.  These are only guidelines.  Homework should be completed in a quiet environment free from technology distractions.  In addition, these guidelines do not take into consideration critical times of the year (e.g. mid or end of quarter) when additional time may be needed for project completion or test preparation.  These average estimates do not consider individual student learning styles, needs, efficiencies, or family educational goals (e.g. grades, college/university aspirations, etc.).  In the event a student is experiencing more homework than these guidelines, please contact the appropriate teacher and/or the School Principal for a homework log.  Click here for
