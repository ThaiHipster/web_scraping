Governance Model
Since its inception, St. Croix Preparatory Academy has followed the Carver governance model.  This model is designed to empower boards of directors to fulfill their obligations of accountability for the organizations they govern.  The model enables the board to focus on the larger issues (e.g. fiscal accountability, student achievement, and strategic initiatives), delegate operational responsibility with clarity (e.g. hiring, curriculum, student discipline, programming, etc.), to oversee management’s job without meddling, and to rigorously evaluate the accomplishment of the organization.
The Board of St. Croix Prep demands accomplishment of purpose and only limits the staff’s means to those which do not violate the board’s understood standards of prudence and ethics.
