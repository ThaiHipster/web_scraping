DETROIT, Mich., April7, 2014
—Ateacher with a passion for cooking and a local restaurant owner with a generousheart is the perfect recipe for a new cooking club at Detroit EnterpriseAcademy.  
Theafterschool program called Junior Chefs caters to fourth-grade students eagerto develop their culinary skills. Second-grade teacher Maham Ahmed started theprogram in February because she wanted to help her students become aware ofwhat they are putting in their bodies, while promoting healthy choices thatthey can prepare at home.
“Mypassion for cooking is nearly as deep as my love for teaching,” Ahmed said. “Iwanted to teach students practical skills and get them excited about eatingwell in an interactive way. It can start with swapping out healthieringredients for higher fat ones that they may not even realize they areconsuming.” 
The12 students are involved in every aspect of being a chef from cleanliness andwashing of hands/utensils, to knife skills and following directions in order.They help choose the recipe they will cook from, chop the fresh ingredients,measure the liquids, mix, bake, and even enjoy the fruits of their labor. Allof the ingredients are provided by Legends Grill, a local restaurant in theschool’s neighborhood.
“Idid not want to charge the students to participate in Junior Chefs; I wanted itto be something I could provide for them,” said Ahmed. “So I asked Lon Llesha,the owner of Legends, to be our partner and he happily accepted. We are sograteful for our partnership with Legends!”
Mahamsaid Junior Chefs is a great way to reinforce learning objectives in math,literacy, and science because the students are having so much fun and arecommitted to turning out a great food product.
“Inever had an avocado before, and I learned they are healthy and yummy!” saidjunior chef Diera Hudson. “I also learned you can use ground turkey instead ofground beef because it has less fat, same with low fat cheese.”
DeshawnteSellers says she loves writing the recipes they make in class in her ownpersonal cookbook. “I go home and show my family how to cook what I learnbecause the recipes are easy and so good.”
Mahamsaid she hopes her junior chefs will develop their own passion for cooking andhealthy eating. The chefs have their first public event coming up on May 15when they will create all refreshments for a school open house. 
DetroitEnterprise Academy is a free public charter school serving students in gradeskindergarten through eighth.
