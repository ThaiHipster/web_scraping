The nearly 1,500 lunch bags that crowded tables at Detroit Enterprise Academy on Wednesday showed how much the community hoped to honor military members on Veterans Day.
At Detroit Enterprise Academy, some 100 students, parents and volunteers gathered at the K-8 charter school on the city’s east side to assemble then stuff the  bags with sandwiches, snacks and beverages for homeless veterans, principal Chanavia Patterson said.
It was the second year the school has participated in the effort spearheaded by the nonprofit International Brown Bag Lunches of Love, which is set to distribute the goods, she said.
Target, Parkway Foods, Coca-Cola and other businesses joined parents in donating the items, while the students also contributed handwritten “love notes” expressing their thanks for the veterans’ service, Patterson said.
Since the academy pupils focus on learning about a specific virtue each month and November’s is gratitude, the Veterans Day giveaway “tied in perfectly,” Patterson said.
“It was important to us to show the connection to our students on how their moral-focused values go back into the community and why it’s important to instill that … they can grow up as better citizens of the world.”
The effort also drew some veterans, who helped alongside the students, said David Rudolph, who is on the academy’s board of directors.
“This gave kids a chance to respect the uniform, respect the men and women who to defend our freedom and way of life,” he said. “It was all about giving back.”
