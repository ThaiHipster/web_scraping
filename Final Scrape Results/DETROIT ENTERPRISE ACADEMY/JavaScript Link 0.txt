Why Detroit Enterprise Academy?
                Founded on academic excellence, moral focus, parental partnership, and student responsibility, Detroit Enterprise Academy is a school like no other – one that can lead to a lifetime of success. We provide a safe learning environment and our exceptional teachers individualize instruction based on your child’s needs. In addition, we focus on real-world skills and how to be a good person. Our students also draft a social contract that reinforces their commitment to their school, their teacher, and each other.            
                "My daughter has been very successful this year. She is a completely different child and is doing great. I tell everyone about the school."
