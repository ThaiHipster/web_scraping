DETROIT, Mich.,  Dec. 10, 2014—
While studentexcitement builds toward winter break, Detroit Enterprise Academy’s principalis reminding parents about the importance of keeping children engaged inlearning even during the holidays. 
“Thistime of year, students really enjoy reading holiday-related books so a trip tothe library to stock up on some fresh reading material is a great idea,” saidPrincipal Chanavia Patterson. “We encourage our parents to limit televisiontime and plan a few educational activities over break.”
Pattersonshared five fun ways parents can incorporate learning into all of the familyfun during the holidays.  Winter breakactivities can include:  
o
Reading for pleasure
: Find your favorite holiday book andhave your child read aloud for family members and friends. See how many booksthey can read during their winter break. 
o
Make Cooking a Lesson: 
Have your child help make holidaytreats for family, friends, or neighbors. Have them help with the measuring,baking time, and even attach a homemade card. 
o
Write, Write, Write: `
Tis the season to spread joy! Haveyour child write notes or cards and practice their spelling and handwriting. 
o
Host a Game Night:
 Invite family, friends, or neighborsover for some friendly competition. Use reading, math, and problem solvingskills during this evening of fun! 
o
Make the Most of Car Rides: 
Have your child count cards, readstreet signs, or practice math facts with flashcards. 
“Twoweeks is a long time if a student is not stretching their mind, and we donotice it when school is back in session in January,” Patterson said. “Thesetips can help eliminate learning loss while allowing students to enjoy timewith their families during winter break.”
DetroitEnterprise Academy is a free public charter school serving students in gradeskindergarten through eighth.
