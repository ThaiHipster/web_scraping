Preparing students for college readiness is a task the staff at Detroit Enterprise Academy is dedicated to every day. Teachers and administrators use a variety of learning techniques to ensure each student is reaching their full potential.
Principal Chanavia Patterson knows the instructional hours within a school day are not always enough for each student and sometimes additional help is needed to fully grasp a concept.
“We like to provide a number of after school opportunities to our students so they can receive extra assistance if they are struggling with a concept,” said Patterson. “After school programs provide an opportunity for smaller group instruction and that alone can be really beneficial to some students.”
Detroit Enterprise Academy offers a variety of additional student resources to get them on the path to college readiness including after school tutoring, writing club, homework club, math masters, academic games, and technology club. With fewer students in the classroom after school, teachers can provide individualized instruction and remediation to students.
“Our goal is to prepare students for success in high school and eventually college so we offer a rigorous curriculum and several opportunities for additional assistance so we can see them be successful,” Patterson said.
Academic excellence, one of the school’s four pillars along with parental partnership, moral focus, and student responsibility, means that teachers are working closely with students to shape their critical thinking skills. The idea of academic excellence helps to cater to a variety of learning types and teachers know to put a strong emphasis math, reading, science, and social studies, the foundation of college readiness.
Detroit Enterprise Academy is a free public charter school serving students in kindergarten through eighth grade.
