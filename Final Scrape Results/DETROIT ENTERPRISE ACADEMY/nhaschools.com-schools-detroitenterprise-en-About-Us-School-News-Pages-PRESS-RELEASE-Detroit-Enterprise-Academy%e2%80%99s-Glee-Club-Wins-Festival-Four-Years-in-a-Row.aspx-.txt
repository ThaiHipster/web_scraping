DETROIT, Mich., June18, 2014
—DetroitEnterprise Academy’s glee club earned a first place finish for the fourth yearin a row at the Trills and Thrills Music Festival in Sandusky, Ohio.
The17 member glee club, comprised of students in fifth through eighth grade, isdirected by classically trained singer Kristin Gailliard. She earned abachelor’s and master’s degree in music education and has performed on stagesacross the United States. Now she shares her talent with students at Detroit EnterpriseAcademy as the school’s full time music teacher.
“I’mso proud that Detroit Enterprise Academy supports the arts and music,” said Gailliard.“I started the glee club six years ago because it is so important to offerchildren the opportunity to explore their creative talents. Glee clubincorporates teamwork, showmanship, exposure to a variety of music, and it’s avehicle for learning across all curriculum.”
Theafter school club holds several performances throughout the year including anannual holiday tradition of singing in the community at East English Village inDecember. But the capstone to the year is always the Trills and Thrills MusicFestival in Ohio. This year the group earned a first place award in the showchoir category which means they scored well in musicality, range of dynamics,expressions, and choreography.
Glee clubmember and student Sydney Maben said she enjoyed both the trill and thrill partof the festival including the day pass to Cedar Point. “We sang great, and wewon! Singing on stage allowed me to release my inner soul. It was a wonderfulfeeling,” Maben said.
Gailliardsaid the students have been very open to a variety of music genres they haveperformed over the  years including poptunes, jazz, and appropriate R&B. Song titles have included: “Dancing inthe Moonlight”, “We are the World”, “Route 66”, and “It Don’t Mean a Thing (IfIt Ain’t Got That Swing)”.
“What I havefound is that music provides an opportunity for students to demonstrateexpression and talents they may not be able to do in the classroom or in sports.Every child has a unique talent and it is important that they have theopportunity to be exposed to the arts to see where it might lead them,” said Gailliard.
She hopes tocontinue to grow the glee club as student interest continues to increase yearafter year. 
DetroitEnterprise Academy is a free public charter school serving students in gradeskindergarten through eighth grade.
