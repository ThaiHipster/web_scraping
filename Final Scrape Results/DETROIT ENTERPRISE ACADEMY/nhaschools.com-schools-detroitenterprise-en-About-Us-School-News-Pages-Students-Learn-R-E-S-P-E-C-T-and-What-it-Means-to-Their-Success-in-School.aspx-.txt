DETROIT, Mich.,October 6, 2014
—Studentsat Detroit Enterprise Academy are not only studying math, reading, and sciencethis month, but they are also learning about respect and how it shapes theirpersonal character.
Alongwith an academic program geared toward college prep, Detroit Enterprise alsooffers a Moral Focus curriculum. Each month, teachers incorporate a differentvirtue into their lesson plans. The virtue for October is respect which isreally important for teachers and students to hold for each other in order tohave a successful classroom.
“Ourstudents are learning to respect not only themselves, but their peers andteachers as well,” said Chanavia Patterson, principal of Detroit EnterpriseAcademy. “Respect is a key component to a well-managed classroom so learningcan thrive.”
Othervirtues studied throughout the school year include: gratitude, self-control,perseverance, courage, encouragement, compassion, and integrity. This month,students are invited to share what they have learned through a writing and artcontest held by National Heritage Academies (NHA).
Thecontest started several years ago as a way to encourage students to expandtheir writing skills through the specialized curriculum. Each year 30 students,out of NHA’s 80 schools, are chosen as the winners. Their writing or artwork ispublished in a Moral Focus Anthology that is distributed to all schools.
Eachmonth, the school holds at least one Moral Focus assembly to honor students whoshowcase one of the virtues in the classroom. 
Parentsat Detroit Enterprise Academy enjoy the moral focus program and the addedbenefit it provides students. In the Spring Parent Survey, 89 percent ofparents said the school has delivered on its promise of moral guidance.
“Ourparents are always commenting on what they hear at home from their childrenabout the virtues we study together throughout the year and how proud they areof the way the students embrace making good choices,” said Patterson.
DetroitEnterprise Academy is a free public charter school serving students inkindergarten through eighth grade.
