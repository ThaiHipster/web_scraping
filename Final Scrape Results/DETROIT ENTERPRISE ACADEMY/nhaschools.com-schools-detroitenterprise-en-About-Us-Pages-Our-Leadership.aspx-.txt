OUR LEADERSHIP
Chanavia Patterson, Principal
Why did you choose education as a profession? 
I knew at an early age that I wanted to be a teacher. I have always enjoyed sharing my love of reading and writing with my family and friends. I believe educating others is the best gift anyone can give. Watching a child develop their own love of learning inspires me to continue the journey of education. 
What is your favorite Moral Focus virtue? 
My favorite virtue is compassion. Compassion is at the forefront of everything we do with our staff, students, and parents.
What motivates you every day? 
Seeing my students eager to learn motivates me. Also, when a student drops by the office to ask if we can order a specific series of books that we may not have in our library is also motivation because it lets me know they see the value of reading. 
What is the one thing you wish for every child? 
Compassionate teachers that will take each child under their wing and ensure they are academically prepared for their future.
