Chanavia Patterson, principal of Detroit Enterprise Academy (DEA), was named one of five finalists for the 2017 Michigan Association of Public School Academies (MAPSA) 2017 Administrator of the Year Award.
Patterson was selected from hundreds of nominations across the state for the very competitive annual award. 
“Chanavia is a skilled administrator who went to DEA knowing that the school was culturally and academically struggling,” said Jami Hoeksma, senior director of school quality for National Heritage Academies (NHA). “She built a strong team, cast a vision, and the results followed. She is passionate about creating a great learning environment for students and continues to overcome every challenge faced by urban school leaders.”
Since her first year at DEA in 2013, Patterson has grown the school’s Michigan top-to-bottom ranking. In 2015-2016, this ranking went from the 18
th
 percentile to the 51
st
 percentile. Under her leadership, student performance on the state assessment has grown tremendously. DEA was designated as a “beating the odds” Reward School in 2015-16 by the Michigan Department of Education for outperforming the school's predicted top-to bottom ranking. Under Patterson’s leadership, the school continues to outperform the local district on the state assessment. 
“I am honored to serve and represent the city of Detroit,” said Patterson. “Detroit Enterprise Academy has been through many transitions, but now the staff, students, and parents can truly benefit from the positive culture and outstanding education we are providing. This nomination is not just for me, but for our entire community!” 
Other accomplishments under Patterson’s leadership include:
·
Detroit Enterprise Academy continues to outperform the local district on the state assessment. In 2013-14, DEA exceeded the local district in grades 3-8 by 9 percentage points.
Under Ms. Patterson’s leadership, the school increased that margin and now outperforms (SY2015-16) the local district on the state assessment by 11 percentage points. 
·
Parent satisfaction at DEA is very high and continues to increase.
In spring of 2016, 94 percent of parents were satisfied with their child’s experience at DEA and 93 percent indicated they were likely to recommend Detroit Enterprise to others. 
·
Employees at Detroit Enterprise are satisfied. In spring 2016, employee engagement was 30 percent greater than the global average, and overall employee satisfaction was 100 percent.
On April 26, the finalists for both categories will be honored at a ceremony at the State Capitol. MAPSA plans to announce the final award winners in early May during National Charter School Week.
Congratulations, Mrs. Patterson!
