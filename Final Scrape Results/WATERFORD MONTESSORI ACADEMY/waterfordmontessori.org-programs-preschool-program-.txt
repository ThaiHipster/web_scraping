Early Childhood (3, 4 and early 5's)
In the multi-age settingof the Montessori preschool classroom, three-, four-, and five-year-olds learn from each other and because of each other. Younger children watch and learn from the older children, and older,more socially advanced and capable students become role models to their youngerclassmates.  
The Montessori Early Childhoodclassroom is a “prepared environment”, with furniture and materials that arescaled to fit a preschooler’s physical dimensions.
Although the space is usually divided intofour distinct areas – practical life, sensorial, mathematics, and language –the Montessori Early Childhood curriculum is interdisciplinary and interactive, andno subject is taught in isolation.
Waterford MontessoriAcademy offers a five day a week half-day (8:30am-11:30am) or full-day(8:30am-3:30pm) Early Childhood program.
