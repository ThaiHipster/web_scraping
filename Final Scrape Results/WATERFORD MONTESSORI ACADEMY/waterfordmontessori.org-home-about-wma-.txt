About WMA
Waterford Montessori Academy is a public charter school authorized by Saginaw Valley State University and managed by American Montessori Solutions, Inc.  WMA provides a proven educational alternative to the children and families of Waterford and its neighboring communities.
The Academy offers a tuition-free elementary program for children in Kindergarten through Grade 7, an affordable tuition-based Early Childhood program for 3, 4 and young 5 year-olds, and before and after-school care.  WMA will add one additional grade each year, and will eventually serve students in Pre-Primary through Grade 8.
The philosophy of Dr. Maria Montessori lays the foundation for the program at WMA, and has been aligned to meet common core state standards.  This curriculum framework will promote the intellectual, spiritual, physical, artistic, and academic excellence inherent in each child.
